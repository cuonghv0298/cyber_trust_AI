            ## Provision ID
            A.8.4e

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**
- For organizations using cloud services, they must:
  - Demonstrate understanding of the shared responsibility model for data backup between themselves and their Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
  - Clearly define which party (organization or CSP) is responsible for backing up essential data.
  - Ensure that essential data is actually backed up, either by:
    - The organization itself (e.g., downloading and storing backups offline or on separate media), or
    - Using backup services provided by the CSP, or
    - Using multiple cloud providers for redundancy.

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Prevent data loss due to accidental deletion, ransomware, or CSP failure.
- Ensure recoverability of essential data even if the primary cloud environment is compromised or unavailable.
- Avoid assumptions that the CSP automatically backs up all data.

**Context and Importance:**
- Many cloud services operate on a shared responsibility model: the CSP secures the infrastructure, but the customer is often responsible for data backup.
- Misunderstanding this can lead to critical data loss.
- Offline or independent backups are a key defense against ransomware and cloud outages.

---

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization can clearly articulate the shared responsibility model for their cloud services (e.g., referencing CSP documentation or agreements).
- There is evidence that essential data is backed up, either:
  - By the organization (e.g., periodic downloads to offline storage), or
  - Through CSP-provided backup services (with confirmation of scope and coverage), or
  - By using multiple cloud providers for backup.
- The backup process is documented and covers all essential data in scope.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- The organization cannot explain or demonstrate understanding of the shared responsibility model for backup.
- There is no evidence of any backup process for cloud data.
- The organization assumes the CSP handles all backups without verification or documentation.
- Backups are not performed, or only exist within the same cloud environment without redundancy.

### **Partial Compliance**
- The organization has some backup measures but lacks clarity on roles/responsibilities or coverage.
- Backups are performed, but only for some essential data, or backup frequency is unclear.
- The organization is in the process of implementing proper backups but has not completed the process.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Documentation or policy describing backup responsibilities (e.g., shared responsibility model summary, CSP documentation).
- Screenshots or logs showing backup jobs, schedules, or confirmation of completed backups.
- Evidence of offline or independent backups (e.g., external drive inventory, secondary cloud provider receipts).
- Contracts or service agreements with CSPs specifying backup provisions.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3–6 months).
- Documentation should be specific to the organization’s actual cloud services and data.
- Screenshots/logs must show actual backup activity, not just configuration screens.

### **Red Flags**
- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.
- Outdated or irrelevant evidence (e.g., old backup logs, unrelated CSP documentation).
- Evidence that only describes backup features, not actual implementation.
- No mention of essential data scope or backup frequency.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Clear explanation of which party is responsible for backup (organization vs. CSP).
- Description of how essential data is identified and backed up.
- Evidence that backups are performed and stored independently (offline, separate cloud, etc.).
- Confirmation that backup coverage matches the scope of certification.

### **Acceptable Responses**
- “We use Microsoft 365. According to Microsoft’s shared responsibility model, we are responsible for backing up our data. We use a third-party backup service to back up all SharePoint and OneDrive data weekly, with copies stored in a separate cloud account.”
- “Our CSP provides daily backups of our cloud servers, as confirmed in our service agreement (see attached). We also download monthly snapshots to an encrypted external drive stored offsite.”
- “We use Google Workspace. We export essential data monthly and store it on an external hard drive kept in a secure location.”

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “Our CSP handles all backups for us.” (without evidence or understanding of the shared responsibility model)
- “We don’t need to back up our cloud data because it’s always available.”
- “We plan to implement backups soon.”
- “We only back up some files, not all essential data.”

### **Follow-up Questions**
- Can you provide documentation or a summary of your CSP’s shared responsibility model for backup?
- How do you ensure that all essential data is included in your backups?
- Where are your backups stored, and how often are they performed?
- Can you show evidence of a recent backup or restoration test?

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations, manual backups (e.g., monthly downloads to USB drives) are acceptable if documented and performed regularly.
- Larger organizations should have more formalized and automated backup processes.

### **Resource Constraints**
- “Reasonable effort” means using built-in CSP tools or affordable third-party solutions, not enterprise-grade systems.
- Manual processes are acceptable if they are consistent and cover all essential data.

### **Industry Context**
- Highly regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more frequent or robust backups.
- For organizations handling sensitive data, encrypted backups are recommended.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Assuming CSPs automatically back up all data.
- Backups only within the same cloud environment (no offline or independent copy).
- No regular backup schedule or process.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Lack of evidence showing actual backup activity.
- Policies that are generic or not tailored to the organization’s cloud usage.

### **False Positives**
- Responses that reference backup features but do not show actual use.
- Evidence of backup configuration without proof of execution.

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Does the organization use cloud assets?**
   - If NO: Provision not applicable.
   - If YES: Continue.
2. **Can the organization explain the shared responsibility model for backup?**
   - If NO: FAIL.
   - If YES: Continue.
3. **Is there evidence that essential data is backed up (offline, separate cloud, or via CSP with documented coverage)?**
   - If NO: FAIL.
   - If YES: Continue.
4. **Is the backup process documented and covers all essential data?**
   - If NO: Partial Compliance (request clarification).
   - If YES: PASS.

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.
- If the organization claims full CSP responsibility, verify with CSP documentation.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards for evidence and understanding across all organizations of similar size and cloud usage.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
