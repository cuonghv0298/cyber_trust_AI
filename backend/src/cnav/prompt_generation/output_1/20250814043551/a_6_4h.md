# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4h  
**Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software (Mobile, IoT, Cloud)**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**
- If the organization uses **mobile devices**, **IoT devices**, and/or **cloud environments** within the certification scope, it must implement specific secure configuration controls:
  - **Mobile Devices:**  
    - Devices must not be jail-broken or rooted.
    - Device passcodes must be enabled.
    - Automatic device lock must activate after 2 minutes of inactivity.
    - Apps must only be installed from official/trusted sources.
  - **IoT Devices:**  
    - IoT devices must be on a network separated from core assets/data.
    - Security features (e.g., disabling auto-discovery, UPnP) must be enabled.
    - Where possible, devices should have a Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) rating.
  - **Cloud Environments:**  
    - Security logging and monitoring must be enabled (e.g., API call history, change tracking).

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Prevent unauthorized access and reduce attack surface.
- Limit the impact of compromised devices or accounts.
- Ensure visibility and traceability of actions in cloud environments.
- Mitigate risks from insecure or poorly configured devices.

**Context/Importance:**
- Mobile, IoT, and cloud assets are common attack vectors.
- Baseline controls are essential to prevent common threats (malware, unauthorized access, lateral movement).
- These measures are practical and achievable for most organizations, even with limited resources.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Mobile Devices:**  
  - Clear evidence that jail-breaking/rooting is prohibited and monitored.
  - Passcodes are enforced on all devices.
  - Auto-lock is set to 2 minutes or less.
  - Policy/process ensures apps are only from official/trusted sources.
- **IoT Devices:**  
  - IoT devices are on a segregated network (e.g., VLAN, separate Wi-Fi).
  - Security features (e.g., UPnP, auto-discovery) are disabled or restricted.
  - CLS-rated devices are used where available, or rationale provided if not.
- **Cloud:**  
  - Security logging and monitoring are enabled (e.g., audit logs, API tracking).
  - Evidence of regular review or alerting.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence or policy for any of the required controls.
- Devices are jail-broken/rooted, or no controls to prevent this.
- Passcodes/auto-lock not enforced or set to insecure values.
- Apps can be installed from any source.
- IoT devices are on the same network as sensitive assets/data.
- Security features on IoT devices are not enabled or are explicitly disabled.
- No evidence of cloud logging/monitoring.
- Responses are vague, generic, or lack supporting evidence.

### Partial Compliance
- Some controls are in place, but not all required (e.g., passcodes enabled but no auto-lock).
- Controls are described but not enforced (e.g., “we ask staff not to root devices” but no technical enforcement).
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the asset base.
- For IoT/Cloud, some but not all features are enabled, or only some devices/environments are covered.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Mobile:**  
  - Mobile device management (MDM) policy/screenshots.
  - Device configuration screenshots (passcode, auto-lock).
  - Policy documents or staff communications.
- **IoT:**  
  - Network diagrams showing segregation.
  - Device configuration screenshots (UPnP, auto-discovery settings).
  - Procurement records for CLS-rated devices.
- **Cloud:**  
  - Screenshots of enabled logging/monitoring.
  - Audit log samples.
  - Cloud provider configuration pages.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 6–12 months).
- Screenshots should clearly show relevant settings.
- Policies should be organization-specific, not generic templates.
- Evidence should match the assets in scope.

### Red Flags
- Outdated screenshots or policies.
- Evidence from test/demo environments, not production.
- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.
- Evidence that does not match described assets (e.g., screenshots from different device models).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Explicit mention of each required control for each asset type in scope.
- Concrete examples or screenshots of settings.
- Policies or technical controls that enforce requirements.
- Evidence that covers all relevant devices/environments.

### Acceptable Responses
- “All company-issued mobile devices are managed via MDM. Jail-breaking is blocked, passcodes are enforced, and auto-lock is set to 2 minutes. See attached screenshots and MDM policy.”
- “IoT devices are on a separate Wi-Fi network with no access to internal data. UPnP is disabled on all devices. See network diagram and device settings screenshots.”
- “Cloud logging is enabled for all accounts. Attached are screenshots of the audit log settings and a sample log export.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We tell staff not to root their phones” (no enforcement or evidence).
- “IoT devices are on the same network as everything else.”
- “We trust staff to only install apps from the App Store” (no policy or enforcement).
- “Cloud logging is available but not enabled.”
- “No evidence provided.”

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide screenshots or policy documents showing these settings are enforced?
- How do you ensure staff do not install unauthorized apps?
- How often are cloud logs reviewed, and by whom?
- Are all IoT devices covered by the network segregation?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, manual processes (e.g., regular device checks, simple written policies) may be acceptable if consistently applied.
- Technical enforcement (e.g., MDM) is preferred but not mandatory if resource constraints exist and compensating controls are in place.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means controls are implemented to the extent feasible (e.g., using built-in device settings, free MDM tools, basic network segregation).
- Documentation can be simple but must be clear and specific.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have additional regulatory requirements—note but do not penalize if baseline Cyber Essentials controls are met.
- For organizations with only a few devices, manual checks may suffice.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking personal devices used for work (BYOD).
- Not enforcing auto-lock or passcodes.
- IoT devices left on default settings or not segregated.
- Cloud logging enabled but never reviewed.

### Documentation Issues
- Policies are generic or not tailored to the organization.
- Screenshots are outdated or incomplete.
- No evidence for some asset types in scope.

### False Positives
- Stating controls exist without evidence.
- Policies that are not enforced in practice.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are mobile, IoT, or cloud assets in scope?**
   - If NO: Mark as N/A for this provision.
   - If YES: Continue.

2. **Are all required controls for each asset type described and evidenced?**
   - If YES: PASS.
   - If NO: Continue.

3. **Are some controls missing, not enforced, or not evidenced?**
   - If YES: Mark as Partial Compliance; request clarification or additional evidence.
   - If after follow-up, gaps remain: FAIL.

4. **Is evidence credible, recent, and organization-specific?**
   - If YES: PASS.
   - If NO: FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete after follow-up, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If organization claims technical limitations, assess if compensating controls are reasonable.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations with similar asset types and risk profiles.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, specific, and recent evidence that all required secure configuration controls are in place for mobile, IoT, and cloud assets in scope. Responses must go beyond policy statements and demonstrate actual implementation. Where resource constraints exist, practical and proportionate controls are acceptable if they achieve the security objectives. Incomplete, generic, or unsupported responses should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance, with follow-up as needed.
