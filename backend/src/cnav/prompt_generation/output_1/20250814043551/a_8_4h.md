# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4h  
**Clause: Backup – Back up essential data and store them offline**  
**Provision Requirement:** Backups shall be stored separately (i.e., offline) from the operating environment. Where feasible, backups should be stored offsite, e.g., separate physical location.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that essential data backups are not only created but are also stored in a manner that is physically or logically separated (“offline”) from the main operating environment. Where possible, these backups should also be kept offsite (in a different physical location from the primary systems).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent loss of critical data due to ransomware, malware, or physical disasters affecting the main environment.
- Ensure recoverability of essential data even if the primary environment is compromised.
- Reduce risk of simultaneous compromise of both live data and backups.

**Context and Importance:**  
Storing backups offline and/or offsite is a fundamental defense against threats like ransomware, which can encrypt both live data and connected backups. Offline/offsite storage ensures that, even in the event of a major incident, the organization can restore essential operations.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization demonstrates that essential data backups are stored offline (i.e., not continuously connected to the operating environment).
- There is clear separation between the backup storage and the primary operating environment (e.g., backups on external drives disconnected after backup, or cloud backups with access controls preventing automatic overwrite).
- Where feasible, backups are stored offsite (e.g., at a different physical location, or in a secure cloud service not directly accessible from the main network).
- The process is documented and evidence supports regular implementation.

### FAIL Criteria
- Backups are stored only on devices or locations that are always connected to the operating environment (e.g., network shares, always-connected external drives).
- No evidence of offline or offsite storage.
- Backups are stored on the same physical premises and are not protected from local disasters.
- The organization cannot describe or evidence how backups are separated from the main environment.

### Partial Compliance
- Backups are stored offline but not offsite, and the organization provides a reasonable justification (e.g., very small business, no feasible offsite option).
- Backups are stored offsite but not fully offline, with some mitigating controls.
- The organization is in the process of implementing offline/offsite backups, with a clear and imminent timeline.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Backup policy or procedure documentation describing offline/offsite storage.
- Screenshots or logs showing backup jobs to external/offline media or offsite/cloud locations.
- Photos of physical backup media (e.g., external drives, tapes) and their storage location.
- Service agreements or invoices for offsite/cloud backup services.
- Inventory of backup media and storage locations.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 3-6 months).
- Documentation should clearly indicate the separation/offline/offsite nature of backups.
- Evidence should match the organization’s described backup process.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not specific to the organization.
- Descriptions are vague (“we back up to the cloud” without details).
- No proof of separation or offsite storage.
- Evidence shows backup devices are always connected or stored in the same room as primary systems.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear description of how and where backups are stored.
- Indication that backups are not always connected to the main network.
- Mention of offsite storage (e.g., cloud, secondary office, secure third-party facility).
- Evidence that supports the described process.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We back up essential data daily to an external hard drive, which is disconnected and stored in a locked cabinet after each backup. Once a week, a copy is taken to a manager’s home.”
- “Backups are performed to a cloud service with multi-factor authentication and are not mapped to any local drives.”
- “We use a third-party backup provider; backups are encrypted and stored in a different data center.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We back up to a network drive on the same server.”
- “Backups are stored on an external drive that is always plugged in.”
- “We don’t have offsite backups, but we plan to do this in the future.”
- “We use cloud storage, but it is always synced and accessible from all computers.”

### Follow-up Questions
- How often are backups disconnected or moved offsite?
- Who is responsible for managing and verifying offline/offsite backups?
- Can you provide a recent example or log of a backup being stored offline/offsite?
- How do you ensure that backups are not accessible if the main environment is compromised?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, using external hard drives or USB sticks stored at a staff member’s home or in a secure offsite location is acceptable.
- Larger organizations should have more formalized processes and may use cloud or third-party offsite backup services.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means at least one backup copy is kept offline or offsite, even if manual (e.g., weekly rotation of drives).
- Automated solutions are not required if cost-prohibitive, but manual processes must be reliable and documented.

### Industry Context
- Highly regulated sectors may require more frequent or robust offsite backups.
- Organizations handling sensitive data should ensure encryption of offsite backups.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming cloud backups are “offline” without proper access controls.
- Backups stored on always-connected devices.
- No offsite backup due to perceived inconvenience.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of written backup procedures.
- Evidence not showing actual separation/offsite storage.

### False Positives
- Descriptions of backup processes without supporting evidence.
- “We use cloud backup” with no details on separation or access controls.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are backups stored offline (not always connected to the operating environment)?**
   - If YES, proceed to next step.
   - If NO, FAIL.

2. **Are backups stored offsite (separate physical location or secure cloud), or is there a reasonable justification for not doing so?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, but offline storage is implemented, consider PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.
   - If NO to both, FAIL.

3. **Is there sufficient, credible evidence supporting the described process?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, FAIL or escalate for further review.

### Escalation Criteria
- Unclear or contradictory evidence.
- Organization claims compliance but cannot provide supporting documentation.
- Unusual backup arrangements not covered by standard guidance.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for any partial compliance or exceptions.
- When in doubt, seek senior auditor input or request additional evidence.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, credible evidence that essential data backups are stored offline and, where feasible, offsite. Acceptable solutions may be simple for small organizations but must demonstrate real separation from the operating environment. Responses lacking detail, evidence, or showing always-connected backups should result in a FAIL. Use the decision tree and practical considerations to ensure fair, consistent, and proportionate assessments.
