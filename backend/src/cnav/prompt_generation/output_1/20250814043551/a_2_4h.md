# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4h

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
If the organization continues to use any hardware or software assets that have reached End-of-Support (EOS), it must:
- **Assess and understand the risk** of continued use,
- **Obtain explicit approval from senior management** for continued use,
- **Monitor the asset** until it is replaced.

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Ensure that EOS assets, which no longer receive security updates, are not used without understanding and managing the associated risks.
- Involve senior management in risk acceptance decisions.
- Maintain oversight and monitoring of EOS assets to minimize exposure until they are decommissioned.

**Context & Importance:**  
EOS assets are vulnerable to unpatched security flaws. Without proper risk assessment, approval, and monitoring, these assets can become easy targets for attackers. This provision ensures organizations do not ignore the risks of legacy systems and that their continued use is a conscious, managed decision.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization **identifies all EOS assets** in use.
- There is a **documented risk assessment** for each EOS asset, outlining potential threats and mitigation measures.
- **Senior management approval** for continued use is documented (e.g., signed memo, email, or meeting minutes).
- There is a **procedure or evidence of ongoing monitoring** of the EOS asset (e.g., regular status checks, logs, or review schedules).
- The organization demonstrates a **plan or timeline for replacement** of the EOS asset.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of risk assessment for EOS assets.
- No record of senior management approval for continued use.
- No monitoring procedure or evidence of ongoing oversight.
- The organization is unaware of which assets are EOS.
- Responses are generic, lack specifics, or are unsupported by evidence.

### Partial Compliance
- Some, but not all, EOS assets are covered by risk assessments or approvals.
- Risk assessment is superficial or lacks detail.
- Approval is informal or not clearly from senior management.
- Monitoring is ad-hoc or not documented.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Asset inventory** listing EOS assets.
- **Risk assessment documents** (can be simple, e.g., a risk register entry).
- **Senior management approval** (email, signed document, meeting minutes).
- **Monitoring records** (logs, checklists, review notes).
- **Replacement plan or timeline** (if available).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **current** (within the last 12 months).
- Documents should be **specific** to the identified EOS assets.
- Approvals must be traceable to a senior management role (e.g., CEO, Director, IT Manager).
- Monitoring should show **ongoing activity**, not just a one-off check.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or generic.
- Risk assessments are copy-pasted templates with no asset-specific details.
- Approvals are from junior staff or not clearly from management.
- Monitoring is claimed but not documented.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear identification of EOS assets.
- Specific risk assessment for each EOS asset.
- Explicit, dated approval from senior management.
- Description or evidence of monitoring activities.
- Replacement plan or timeline.

### Acceptable Responses
- "We have two EOS Windows 7 PCs. A risk assessment was conducted (see attached), and the IT Manager approved continued use until Q4 2024. We monitor these PCs weekly for unusual activity and have scheduled replacement."
- "Our asset register flags EOS software. For each, we complete a risk form, get approval from the CEO, and review status monthly."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We know some assets are EOS but have no formal process."
- "Senior management is aware, but nothing is documented."
- "We plan to replace them soon, but no risk assessment or approval is in place."
- "We don't have any EOS assets" (if evidence suggests otherwise).

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide the actual risk assessment document for [specific asset]?
- Who in senior management approved continued use, and when?
- How do you monitor the EOS asset? Can you show recent monitoring records?
- What is your timeline for replacing this asset?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, risk assessments and approvals can be simple (e.g., a one-page document or an email chain), as long as they are specific and traceable.
- Monitoring can be manual (e.g., a checklist or logbook).

### Resource Constraints
- Accept basic but clear documentation (e.g., spreadsheet, email).
- Do not require enterprise-grade risk management tools.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements for EOS assets; note if sectoral regulations apply.
- For organizations with critical systems, ensure risk assessments are proportionate to the potential impact.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Failure to identify all EOS assets.
- Risk assessments are missing or generic.
- Senior management approval is assumed, not documented.
- Monitoring is not ongoing or not evidenced.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is outdated or not asset-specific.
- Approvals are unsigned or from inappropriate roles.
- Monitoring records are missing or incomplete.

### False Positives
- Responses that mention processes but provide no supporting evidence.
- Risk assessments that are boilerplate and not tailored to the asset.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are there any EOS assets in use?**
   - If NO: PASS (if supported by up-to-date asset inventory).
   - If YES: Proceed to next steps.

2. **Is there a documented risk assessment for each EOS asset?**
   - If NO: FAIL.
   - If YES: Proceed.

3. **Is there documented senior management approval for continued use?**
   - If NO: FAIL.
   - If YES: Proceed.

4. **Is there evidence of ongoing monitoring of the EOS asset?**
   - If NO: FAIL.
   - If YES: PASS.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.
- If the organization claims no EOS assets but evidence suggests otherwise, seek clarification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for documentation and approval across all organizations.
- Accept proportionate evidence for small organizations, but require all three elements: risk assessment, management approval, and monitoring.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate (with proportionate evidence) that it has identified EOS assets, assessed and documented the risks, obtained senior management approval, and is actively monitoring the assets until replacement. Incomplete, generic, or undocumented processes should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.
