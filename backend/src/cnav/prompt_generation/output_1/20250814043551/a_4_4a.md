# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4a  
**Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Protect from malicious software like viruses and malware**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must have anti-malware solutions installed and actively used on all endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops, servers, virtual environments) to detect and prevent malicious software attacks.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent, detect, and respond to malware threats (viruses, ransomware, spyware, etc.)
- Ensure all endpoints are protected, minimizing the risk of compromise
- Maintain a baseline of security hygiene across the organization

**Context & Importance:**  
Malware is a leading cause of data breaches and operational disruption. Resource-constrained organizations are frequent targets due to perceived weaker defenses. This provision ensures that basic, effective anti-malware controls are in place, forming a critical first line of defense.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Anti-malware software is installed and active on all endpoints** (laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines).
- **The solution is up-to-date** (receives regular signature/definition updates).
- **Coverage is organization-wide** (no significant gaps in deployment).
- **Staff responsible for management are identified** (even if outsourced).
- **Evidence of recent scans or detections** (e.g., scan logs, screenshots, reports).
- **If EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) or similar advanced controls are used, their anti-malware capabilities are clearly described.**

### FAIL Criteria
- **No anti-malware solution is in place** on one or more endpoints.
- **Anti-malware is outdated, disabled, or not centrally managed.**
- **No evidence of deployment or operation** (e.g., no logs, screenshots, or reports).
- **Significant endpoint types are unprotected** (e.g., servers, remote laptops).
- **Responses are vague or generic** (e.g., “We have antivirus” with no specifics).

### Partial Compliance
- **Some endpoints are protected, but not all** (e.g., desktops covered, but servers or remote laptops are not).
- **Anti-malware is installed but not regularly updated or monitored.**
- **Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of the environment.**
- **Unclear who is responsible for management.**
- **In these cases, request clarification or additional evidence.**

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Screenshots** of anti-malware software installed on endpoints (showing product name, update status, scan results).
- **Inventory lists** indicating anti-malware deployment status.
- **Scan logs or reports** (recent, within the last month).
- **Policy documents** (if available) describing anti-malware requirements.
- **Service provider contracts** (if anti-malware is managed externally).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- **Evidence must be recent** (within the last 1-2 months).
- **Screenshots/logs must clearly show endpoint names and anti-malware status.**
- **Evidence should cover a representative sample of all endpoint types.**
- **If using managed services, documentation should specify anti-malware coverage.**

### Red Flags
- **Screenshots or logs are outdated or undated.**
- **Evidence only covers a single device or is not representative.**
- **Product names are missing or unclear.**
- **Evidence appears generic, templated, or not organization-specific.**
- **No evidence provided, or only policy statements without proof of implementation.**

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: "Any vulnerability-assessment (VA) scans conducted? Can you share frequency and remediation details, and who manages this?"
- **What to Look For:**  
  - Mention of anti-malware scans as part of VA process.
  - Frequency of scans (e.g., daily, weekly).
  - Identification of responsible staff or service provider.
  - Evidence of scan results and remediation actions.

- **Acceptable Responses:**  
  - “We run weekly anti-malware scans on all endpoints using [Product Name]. IT Manager reviews results and remediates as needed. See attached scan logs.”
  - “Our managed service provider runs daily scans and provides monthly reports. See attached sample report.”

- **Unacceptable Responses:**  
  - “We do scans sometimes.” (No details or evidence)
  - “Not sure who manages this.”
  - “We rely on Windows Defender but have no logs.”

- **Follow-up Questions:**  
  - “Can you provide screenshots or logs from recent scans?”
  - “Are all endpoint types included in these scans?”
  - “Who is responsible for ensuring anti-malware is up-to-date?”

### Q2: "Are there any security controls (e.g., EDR) installed on machines?"
- **What to Look For:**  
  - Specific mention of anti-malware or EDR products.
  - Confirmation of deployment across all endpoints.
  - Evidence of installation and operation.

- **Acceptable Responses:**  
  - “All endpoints have [Product Name] anti-malware installed and updated automatically.”
  - “We use [EDR Product] which includes anti-malware features. See attached deployment report.”

- **Unacceptable Responses:**  
  - “We have some antivirus, but not sure where.”
  - “Only some computers have protection.”
  - “No security controls installed.”

- **Follow-up Questions:**  
  - “Can you provide a list of protected endpoints?”
  - “How do you ensure new devices are protected?”
  - “How do you monitor anti-malware status?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- **Very small organizations (≤10 staff):**  
  - May use built-in solutions (e.g., Windows Defender) if enabled and updated.
  - Evidence can be limited to a sample of all devices.
- **Larger organizations:**  
  - Expect more formalized deployment and monitoring.

### Resource Constraints
- **Reasonable effort:**  
  - Use of free or built-in anti-malware is acceptable if properly configured and maintained.
  - Manual checks are acceptable if no central management.

### Industry Context
- **Sectors with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance):**  
  - May require more robust solutions or monitoring.
- **Remote/hybrid work:**  
  - Ensure remote endpoints are also covered.

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only office-based devices protected; remote or BYOD devices unprotected.
- Anti-malware installed but not updated or monitored.
- No clear responsibility for anti-malware management.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated or incomplete evidence.
- Evidence not linked to the organization (e.g., stock images).
- No proof of coverage for all endpoint types.

### False Positives
- Policy documents without operational evidence.
- Screenshots from a single device presented as evidence for all.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is anti-malware installed and active on all endpoints?**
   - If YES, proceed.
   - If NO, FAIL.

2. **Is the anti-malware solution up-to-date and regularly used?**
   - If YES, proceed.
   - If NO, FAIL.

3. **Is there credible, recent evidence of deployment and operation?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, request more evidence or mark as PARTIAL.

4. **Are all endpoint types covered (including remote/virtual)?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL depending on risk.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or contradictory, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.
- If organization claims full coverage but cannot provide evidence, escalate.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and context.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in partial or borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and representative evidence that anti-malware solutions are installed, active, and updated on all endpoints. Responses must specify coverage, management responsibility, and provide proof of operation. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept vague or unsupported claims. Escalate unclear cases and ensure consistent application of criteria.
