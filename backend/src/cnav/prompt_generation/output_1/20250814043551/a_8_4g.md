# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4g  
**Clause: Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline**  
**Provision Requirement:** All backups shall be protected from unauthorised access and be restricted to authorised personnel only. Backups should minimally be password-protected.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
- All essential data backups (including offline backups) must be protected so that only authorised personnel can access them.
- At a minimum, backups must be password-protected.
- The organization must demonstrate that access controls are in place for backup data, whether stored on physical media (e.g., USB drives, external hard disks) or in cloud/offsite locations.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorised access, theft, or tampering with backup data.
- Ensure that, in the event of a cyber incident, backups remain a reliable and uncompromised source for recovery.
- Reduce risk of data breaches via backup compromise.

**Context/Importance:**  
Backups are a prime target for attackers. If not properly protected, they can be accessed, deleted, or used to extort the organization. Password protection and access restriction are baseline controls that significantly reduce this risk, especially for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Backups (both online and offline) are protected by at least password protection.
- Access to backups is limited to a defined set of authorised personnel.
- The organization can describe or show how backup access is controlled (e.g., password, encryption, physical lock, access list).
- Evidence supports that controls are in place and in use.

### FAIL Criteria
- Backups are not password-protected or otherwise access-controlled.
- All staff or unauthorised individuals can access backups.
- No evidence or only vague statements about backup protection.
- Organization cannot identify who is authorised to access backups.

### Partial Compliance
- Backups are password-protected, but access controls are informal or not documented.
- Some, but not all, backups are protected.
- Passwords are weak, shared widely, or not changed when staff leave.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some backup types/locations.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots/photos of backup software settings showing password/encryption enabled.
- Written procedures or policies listing authorised personnel for backup access.
- Access logs or audit trails (if available).
- Photos of physical storage (e.g., locked cabinet for external drives).
- List of backup locations and protection methods.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Evidence must clearly show password protection or access restriction.
- If written, must specify who is authorised and how access is managed.

### Red Flags
- Generic statements (“We keep backups safe”) with no supporting detail.
- Evidence showing default or weak passwords (e.g., “1234”, “password”).
- Evidence is outdated or refers to former staff.
- No mention of offline backup protection.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear description of how backups are protected (password, encryption, physical security).
- Identification of who is authorised to access backups.
- Evidence that matches the described controls.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Backups are stored on an encrypted external drive, kept in a locked cabinet. Only the IT manager and director have the key and password.”
- “Cloud backups are protected by unique passwords and only accessible to the IT administrator. Access is reviewed quarterly.”
- Screenshot of backup software showing password/encryption enabled.

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We keep backups in the office.”
- “Everyone can access the backup drive if needed.”
- “We don’t use passwords for backups, but we trust our staff.”
- No evidence or only a policy with no proof of implementation.

### Follow-up Questions
- Who specifically is authorised to access backups?
- How are passwords managed and changed?
- Are all backup types (cloud, USB, external HDD) protected?
- How is access reviewed or updated when staff change roles or leave?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), it is acceptable if only the owner/manager has access, provided this is documented and password protection is in place.
- For larger organizations, expect a documented list of authorised personnel.

### Resource Constraints
- Password protection is the minimum; encryption is encouraged but not required.
- Physical security (locked drawer/cabinet) is acceptable for offline backups if access is limited.

### Industry Context
- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should be encouraged to use stronger controls, but minimum standard is password protection and access restriction.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Backups are password-protected, but passwords are shared with all staff.
- No process for updating access when staff leave.
- Offline backups left unsecured in shared spaces.

### Documentation Issues
- No evidence of access restriction (e.g., no list of authorised personnel).
- Outdated evidence (e.g., screenshots from years ago).

### False Positives
- Policy states backups are protected, but no evidence of actual implementation.
- Password protection is claimed, but passwords are weak or default.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are all backups (online and offline) protected by at least password protection?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → Continue

2. **Is access to backups restricted to authorised personnel only?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → Continue

3. **Is there credible, current evidence supporting both password protection and access restriction?**
   - If NO → FAIL or PARTIAL (if some evidence exists)
   - If YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request clarification or additional evidence.
- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence, escalate to senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for size and reasonable resource constraints.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical evidence that all essential data backups are protected by at least password protection and that access is limited to authorised personnel. Responses must be supported by current, credible evidence. Resource constraints are considered, but minimum standards must be met for a PASS.
