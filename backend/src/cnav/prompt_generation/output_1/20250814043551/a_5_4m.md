            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4m  
**Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision Requirement:** User accounts shall be disabled and/or locked out after multiple failed login attempts, e.g., after ten (10) failed login attempts, or by ‘throttling’ the rate of attempts.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must implement technical controls that automatically disable or lock user accounts after a defined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 10). Alternatively, they may implement mechanisms that slow (‘throttle’) repeated login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access via brute-force password guessing.
- Detect and respond to abnormal login activity.
- Limit the risk of account compromise due to weak or reused passwords.

**Context and Importance:**  
This is a foundational security control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources. It is a common attack vector and a basic expectation for any system handling sensitive or business-critical data.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a technical control in place that:
  - Automatically disables or locks user accounts after a set number of failed login attempts (ideally 10 or fewer).
  - OR, implements login throttling to slow down repeated failed attempts.
- The control is enabled and enforced for all user accounts on all relevant systems (e.g., endpoints, servers, cloud services, business applications).
- The organization can demonstrate or describe how this control is configured and monitored.

### FAIL Criteria
- No technical control exists to lock or disable accounts after failed login attempts.
- The control is only partially implemented (e.g., only on some systems, or only for admin accounts).
- The organization relies solely on manual monitoring or post-incident response.
- The organization cannot describe or provide evidence of the control.

### Partial Compliance
- The control is implemented on some, but not all, systems or accounts.
- The lockout threshold is set unreasonably high (e.g., more than 20 attempts) or is not clearly defined.
- The organization is in the process of implementing the control but it is not yet fully in place.
- The organization uses alternative controls (e.g., login throttling) but cannot clearly explain or evidence their effectiveness.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of account lockout policy settings from operating systems, directory services (e.g., Active Directory), or cloud admin consoles.
- Policy documents or configuration guides showing lockout/throttling settings.
- System logs or reports showing account lockout events.
- Descriptions of how the control is implemented and monitored.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Screenshots must clearly show relevant settings (e.g., number of failed attempts, lockout duration).
- Policy documents must be organization-specific, not generic templates.
- Descriptions must be specific to the organization’s environment.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is missing, outdated, or generic.
- Screenshots are cropped, unclear, or do not show relevant settings.
- Policies are not enforced or are only aspirational.
- The organization cannot explain how the control works in practice.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**IT: Are there endpoint controls to detect abnormal account access (e.g., multiple failed logins, logins at odd hours)?**

#### What to Look For
- Clear description of technical controls that detect and respond to multiple failed login attempts.
- Mention of account lockout or login throttling features.
- Evidence that these controls are enabled and enforced.
- Coverage across all relevant systems (not just a subset).

#### Acceptable Responses
- “We have configured Windows Group Policy to lock accounts after 10 failed login attempts. See attached screenshot.”
- “Our cloud service (e.g., Microsoft 365) automatically locks accounts after 10 failed attempts. See admin console screenshot.”
- “We use endpoint security software that detects and blocks repeated failed login attempts. See configuration guide.”
- “We have login throttling enabled on our web portal, which slows down repeated failed attempts.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We monitor login attempts manually and respond if we see something suspicious.”
- “We don’t have this control, but we plan to implement it in the future.”
- “Our users are trained to use strong passwords, so this is not necessary.”
- “We only lock accounts for admin users, not regular staff.”
- No evidence or only generic policy statements.

#### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide a screenshot or policy document showing the lockout/throttling configuration?”
- “Is this control applied to all user accounts and systems, or only some?”
- “How do you monitor or get notified when an account is locked out?”
- “When was this control last tested or reviewed?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), controls may be implemented via built-in OS settings or cloud service defaults.
- Manual monitoring is not sufficient; some automated control is required, even if basic.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or built-in controls (e.g., Windows Group Policy, cloud admin settings) are acceptable.
- Third-party tools are not required if built-in controls are used effectively.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with regulatory requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare) may need stricter thresholds.
- For organizations with only cloud-based systems, evidence should focus on cloud admin settings.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Control only applied to admin accounts, not all users.
- Lockout threshold set too high (e.g., 50 attempts).
- Control not enabled on all systems (e.g., only on desktops, not laptops or cloud services).

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots or policies are outdated or not organization-specific.
- Evidence does not clearly show lockout/throttling settings.

### False Positives
- Descriptions that sound compliant but lack supporting evidence.
- Policies that are not actually enforced in practice.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a technical control that locks/disables accounts or throttles login attempts after multiple failures?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

2. **Is the control enabled and enforced for all user accounts and relevant systems?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification or evidence)
   - **Yes:** Proceed

3. **Is there credible, current evidence (e.g., screenshots, policy documents) showing the control is in place?**
   - **No:** FAIL (unless partial compliance and evidence can be provided)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional information.
- If the organization claims alternative controls, escalate to a senior auditor for review.
- If partial compliance is identified, document gaps and request remediation plan or timeline.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, regardless of size, unless justified by documented resource constraints.
- Ensure that evidence is reviewed for all relevant systems (endpoints, servers, cloud).
- Document rationale for each decision to support consistent future assessments.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, current evidence that user accounts are automatically locked or login attempts are throttled after multiple failures, covering all relevant systems. Manual processes or incomplete coverage are not sufficient. Responses must be specific, supported by evidence, and reflect actual practice, not just policy intent. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but require at least basic automated controls. Escalate unclear or borderline cases for further review.
