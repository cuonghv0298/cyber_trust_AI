# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4k  
**Dormant or inactive accounts which have been inactive for a prolonged period, e.g., sixty (60) days should be removed or disabled.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must have a process to identify user accounts (including staff, contractors, and service accounts) that have not been used for a prolonged period (suggested: 60 days) and ensure such accounts are either removed or disabled in a timely manner.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Minimize the risk of unauthorized access via forgotten or unused accounts.
- Reduce the attack surface by ensuring only active, necessary accounts exist.
- Prevent exploitation of dormant accounts by malicious actors.

**Context & Importance:**  
Dormant accounts are a common target for attackers, as they are often overlooked and may not be monitored. Removing or disabling these accounts is a fundamental access control measure that significantly reduces risk, especially for organizations with limited resources and expertise.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a documented and implemented process to identify and remove/disable accounts inactive for a defined period (ideally 60 days, but up to 90 days may be acceptable for small organizations).
- The process covers all relevant systems (e.g., email, file servers, cloud services, business applications).
- Evidence shows the process is followed in practice (e.g., recent account review logs, screenshots, or policy documents).
- The process is applied consistently, not just ad hoc.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process exists, or the process is only informal/verbal with no supporting evidence.
- The process is not implemented (e.g., accounts remain active indefinitely regardless of use).
- The inactivity threshold is unreasonably long (e.g., >180 days) without justification.
- The process only covers some systems, leaving significant gaps.

### Partial Compliance
- The process exists but is inconsistently applied or only covers some systems.
- The inactivity threshold is slightly longer than 60 days (e.g., 90 days) but justified by business needs.
- Evidence is incomplete or outdated, requiring clarification or additional documentation.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedures or policy documents describing the process.
- Screenshots of account management tools showing inactive account identification.
- Logs or reports from recent account reviews (redacted as needed).
- Examples of disabled/removed accounts with dates.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 6–12 months).
- Documentation should be clear, specific, and relevant to the organization’s actual systems.
- Screenshots/logs should demonstrate real activity, not just templates.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or unrelated to the organization’s environment.
- No proof of actual account removals/disabling.
- Policy exists but no evidence of implementation.
- Evidence appears fabricated or copied from online sources.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear description of the process for identifying and handling inactive accounts.
- Defined inactivity threshold (ideally 60 days, up to 90 days with justification).
- List of systems covered by the process.
- Evidence of recent account reviews and actions taken.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We run a monthly report from our Active Directory to identify accounts inactive for 60 days. These are reviewed and disabled by the IT administrator. Attached are screenshots of our last review and a copy of our access control policy.”
- “Our cloud service provider automatically disables accounts after 60 days of inactivity. Here is a screenshot of the configuration and a log of recent disabled accounts.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We don’t have many users, so we don’t need this.”
- “We remove accounts when someone tells us to.”
- “We have a policy, but no evidence of it being followed.”
- “We only check email accounts, not other systems.”

### Follow-up Questions
- Which systems are included in your inactive account review process?
- How often is the review conducted?
- Can you provide a recent example of an account that was disabled or removed due to inactivity?
- How is the process documented and communicated to relevant staff?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple manual review process is acceptable if documented and performed regularly.
- Automated tools are not required, but the process must be demonstrable.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means a periodic (e.g., monthly or quarterly) manual check is sufficient for small teams.
- The inactivity threshold can be up to 90 days if justified by business needs.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with high staff turnover or sensitive data may require stricter controls.
- For sectors with regulatory requirements, ensure alignment with those standards.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only some systems are covered (e.g., email but not cloud storage).
- No regular review schedule—only ad hoc removals.
- Inactivity threshold is undefined or too long.

### Documentation Issues
- Policies are generic or not tailored to the organization.
- No evidence of actual account removals/disabling.

### False Positives
- Policy exists but no proof of implementation.
- Evidence is staged for the audit, not part of regular practice.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented process for identifying and removing/disabling inactive accounts?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

2. **Is the inactivity threshold defined and reasonable (≤90 days)?**
   - If NO → FAIL (unless strong justification)
   - If YES → proceed

3. **Is the process applied to all relevant systems?**
   - If NO → Partial/FAIL (depending on risk)
   - If YES → proceed

4. **Is there recent evidence of the process being followed?**
   - If NO → Partial/FAIL
   - If YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims alternative controls or business justifications that are not standard.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same threshold for evidence and process rigor across similar organizations.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, documented, and implemented process for identifying and removing or disabling dormant accounts across all relevant systems, with evidence of recent activity. The process should be proportionate to the organization’s size and resources but must be real and effective. Incomplete, ad hoc, or undocumented approaches should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.
