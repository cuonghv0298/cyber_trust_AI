            ## Evaluation Prompt

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4d  
**Clause: Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software**  
**Provision Requirement:** Features, services, or applications that are not in use shall be disabled or removed (e.g., disabling file sharing services, software macros, and FTP ports).

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that any features, services, or applications on their hardware and software that are not actively needed for business operations are either disabled or completely removed. This includes, but is not limited to, unnecessary file sharing services, unused software macros, and open ports such as FTP that are not required.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary components that could be exploited.
- Prevent unauthorized access or misuse of dormant services.
- Ensure only essential and secure functionalities are available on organizational systems.

**Context & Importance:**  
Unused features and services are common entry points for attackers. Disabling or removing them is a fundamental security practice that significantly lowers risk, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization demonstrates a clear process for identifying and disabling/removing unused features, services, or applications.
- Evidence shows that unnecessary services (e.g., file sharing, macros, FTP ports) are disabled or removed on all relevant systems.
- The response covers both initial system setup and ongoing maintenance (e.g., periodic reviews).

### FAIL Criteria
- No process or policy exists for disabling/removing unused features/services.
- The organization cannot provide evidence or examples of disabled/removed features.
- The response is generic, lacks specifics, or only states intent without action.
- Unused features/services are knowingly left enabled without justification.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization has started disabling/removing unused features but coverage is incomplete (e.g., only on some systems).
- The process is informal or ad hoc, with limited documentation.
- Some features/services are disabled, but others are overlooked or not addressed.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of system/service configuration panels showing disabled features/services.
- Lists or inventories of enabled/disabled services on representative devices.
- Policy or procedural documents outlining the disabling/removal process.
- Change logs or records of configuration changes.
- Statements from IT personnel describing the process (for very small organizations).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Screenshots or lists should clearly identify the system and the disabled features/services.
- Policies/procedures should be relevant and reflect actual practice.
- Evidence should cover a representative sample of systems (not just one device).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to the organization.
- Screenshots or lists are incomplete or do not show disabled features.
- Policies exist but are not implemented in practice.
- Evidence appears to be copied from online sources or templates without customization.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**"Are unused features, services or applications disabled or removed?"**

#### What to Look For
- Specific mention of which features/services/applications are disabled or removed.
- Description of how the organization identifies what is "unused."
- Evidence of actual implementation (not just policy).
- Coverage across all relevant systems (workstations, servers, network devices).

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We review all new computers and disable file sharing, unused network ports, and macros in Office applications. See attached screenshots from three staff laptops and our server."
- "Our IT provider runs a monthly check to ensure only required services are enabled. Attached is a checklist and screenshots from our firewall and endpoint management tool."
- "We have a policy to remove all pre-installed software not needed for business. See the attached inventory and removal logs."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We try to keep things secure and only use what we need." (No specifics or evidence)
- "We have antivirus, so we are protected." (Irrelevant to this provision)
- "We don’t know what services are running, but we haven’t had any issues."
- "We plan to review this in the future."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide examples of features or services you have disabled or removed recently?"
- "How do you determine which features/services are not needed?"
- "Is this process applied to all devices, including servers and laptops?"
- "How often do you review enabled features/services?"

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple checklist and a few screenshots may suffice.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized procedures and broader evidence coverage.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual reviews are acceptable if automated tools are not available.
- Outsourced IT providers can perform this function, but the organization must be able to describe the process and provide evidence.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors may require specific features (e.g., FTP for legacy systems). In such cases, the organization must justify why a feature is enabled and demonstrate compensating controls.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only disabling/removing features on new devices, not existing ones.
- Overlooking network devices (e.g., routers, firewalls).
- Assuming default settings are secure without verification.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence for ongoing maintenance (only initial setup covered).
- Screenshots or lists that do not clearly show disabled features/services.
- Policies that are not implemented in practice.

### False Positives
- Responses that mention antivirus or unrelated controls as evidence.
- Generic statements without supporting documentation.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence that unused features/services/applications are identified and disabled/removed?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

2. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and covers a representative sample of systems?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request more evidence or clarification)
   - **Yes:** Proceed

3. **Is the process ongoing (not just a one-time activity)?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification on ongoing process)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims exceptions (e.g., must keep FTP enabled), escalate for risk review and compensating controls assessment.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and specific evidence that unused features, services, or applications are disabled or removed across all relevant systems. Acceptable responses must go beyond intent and demonstrate actual implementation. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement of reducing unnecessary attack surfaces. Escalate unclear or incomplete cases for further review.
