# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4f  
**Clause**: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services  
**Provision**: The administrator account shall only be accessed to perform administrator functions with approval from the senior management.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**Practical Requirement:**  
This provision requires that access to administrator (admin) accounts—those with elevated privileges to manage systems, data, or services—is strictly controlled. Specifically, admin accounts should only be used for admin tasks, and each instance of access must be approved by senior management (e.g., business owner, director, or equivalent).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized or unnecessary use of powerful admin accounts.
- Ensure accountability and oversight for all admin-level activities.
- Reduce risk of accidental or malicious changes to critical systems.

**Context & Importance:**  
Admin accounts are a primary target for attackers and a common source of accidental misconfiguration. Requiring senior management approval for admin access ensures that such access is deliberate, justified, and monitored, which is critical for baseline security, especially in organizations with limited IT resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- There is a clear, documented process requiring senior management approval before admin accounts are accessed or used.
- The process is known and followed by relevant staff.
- Evidence (e.g., approval records, emails, logs) demonstrates that admin access is only granted after explicit senior management approval.
- Admin accounts are not used for day-to-day activities; access is limited to necessary admin functions.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process exists for senior management approval of admin access.
- Admin accounts are used routinely without oversight or approval.
- Approval is informal, undocumented, or delegated to non-senior staff.
- No evidence of approval or access control is provided.

### Partial Compliance
- There is a process, but it is inconsistently applied or not documented.
- Approval is sometimes obtained, but not always from senior management.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some admin access events.
- Organization is in the process of implementing the requirement but has not fully operationalized it.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written policy or procedure describing the approval process for admin access.
- Records of senior management approval (e.g., signed forms, approval emails, ticketing system logs).
- Access logs showing admin account usage tied to approval events.
- Staff communications or training records referencing the process.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months) and relevant to current practices.
- Documentation should clearly identify who is considered "senior management."
- Approval records should be specific (who approved, for what purpose, when).
- Evidence should cover all admin accounts in use.

### Red Flags
- Vague or generic statements without supporting documentation.
- Evidence that is outdated, incomplete, or not specific to admin access.
- Policies that mention approval but do not specify senior management involvement.
- Approval records signed by IT staff or junior employees, not senior management.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**"Is administrative access only granted with approval from senior management?"**

#### What to Look For
- Description of the approval process, including who approves and how approval is documented.
- Examples of recent approval events.
- Evidence that admin access is not used for routine tasks.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "All admin access requests are submitted to the Managing Director for approval via email. Access is only granted after written approval is received. See attached approval emails and access logs."
- "We have a policy requiring the owner to approve all admin access. Attached is the policy and a sample approval record from last month."
- "Admin accounts are disabled by default and only enabled temporarily with written approval from the CEO. See attached screenshots and approval records."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "Admin access is only used by IT staff as needed" (no mention of senior management approval).
- "We trust our IT team to use admin accounts responsibly."
- "Approval is verbal and not documented."
- "No evidence provided."

#### Follow-up Questions
- Who in your organization is considered senior management for the purposes of admin access approval?
- Can you provide a recent example of an admin access request and the corresponding approval?
- How is the approval recorded and retained?
- How do you ensure that admin accounts are not used for non-admin tasks?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), "senior management" may be the business owner or director. Approval can be via simple documented email or signed note.
- For sole proprietors, self-approval is not meaningful; instead, ensure admin accounts are only used when necessary and access is logged.

### Resource Constraints
- A simple, documented process (e.g., an email trail or approval log) is sufficient; complex systems are not required.
- Approval can be manual and informal, as long as it is documented and involves senior management.

### Industry Context
- In regulated sectors, more formal approval processes may be expected.
- For organizations with outsourced IT, ensure the approval process includes oversight by the organization's own senior management, not just the IT vendor.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming IT staff approval is sufficient.
- Lack of documentation for approval events.
- Admin accounts used for daily operations without restriction.

### Documentation Issues
- Policies that are generic or not tailored to the organization.
- Missing or outdated approval records.
- Evidence that does not clearly link approval to admin access events.

### False Positives
- Stating that approval is required but providing no evidence.
- Policies that mention approval but do not specify who approves or how.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented process requiring senior management approval for admin access?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Is there evidence that this process is followed (e.g., approval records, logs)?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and clearly involves senior management?**
   - **No** → Partial Compliance (request more evidence or clarification)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or approval authority is unclear, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.
- If the organization claims to be in transition (e.g., implementing a new process), assess for partial compliance and set a follow-up review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for what constitutes "senior management" and "documented approval" across all organizations of similar size and structure.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, documented, and consistently applied process requiring senior management approval for all admin account access, supported by recent and specific evidence. Responses lacking documentation, relying on IT staff approval, or providing only generic statements should be marked as FAIL. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but always require some form of documented oversight by the most senior person(s) in the organization.
