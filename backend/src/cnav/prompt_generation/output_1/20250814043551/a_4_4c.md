# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4c  
**(Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection â€“ Auto-updating anti-malware signatures)**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that their anti-malware solutions (e.g., antivirus software, endpoint protection) are configured to automatically update their malware signature files or equivalent detection mechanisms (such as machine learning models) at least daily, or as frequently as possible. This ensures the solution can detect and respond to the latest threats.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Maintain up-to-date protection against newly emerging malware and viruses.
- Minimize the window of vulnerability to new threats.
- Reduce reliance on manual updates, which are prone to human error or neglect.

**Context & Importance:**  
Malware evolves rapidly. Outdated anti-malware solutions are ineffective against new threats, leaving organizations exposed. Automatic, frequent updates are a baseline defense and are especially critical for organizations with limited IT resources, as they reduce the need for manual intervention.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- All anti-malware solutions in use are configured to auto-update signature files or equivalent detection mechanisms.
- Updates occur at least daily (every 24 hours) or more frequently, where possible.
- The organization can demonstrate this configuration through settings, screenshots, or policy documentation.
- If using non-signature-based solutions (e.g., machine learning), evidence shows regular updates to detection models or equivalent mechanisms.

### FAIL Criteria
- Anti-malware solutions are not set to auto-update, or updates are performed manually.
- Updates occur less frequently than daily (e.g., weekly, ad hoc).
- No evidence is provided, or evidence contradicts the self-assessment response.
- The organization is unaware of the update frequency or cannot demonstrate the configuration.

### Partial Compliance
- Some, but not all, devices or systems have auto-updates enabled.
- Updates are set to occur, but frequency is unclear or less than daily.
- The organization claims technical limitations but does not provide reasonable justification or compensating controls.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of systems.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of anti-malware settings showing auto-update enabled and update frequency.
- Policy documents or IT procedures specifying update configuration.
- Logs or reports from anti-malware solutions showing recent automatic updates.
- Inventory list mapping anti-malware solutions to devices, with update settings.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 1-2 months).
- Screenshots should clearly show device name, date/time, and relevant settings.
- Policies/procedures must be in active use, not just templates.
- Evidence should cover all relevant devices/endpoints.

### Red Flags
- Screenshots or documents are outdated or generic (e.g., vendor marketing material).
- Evidence only covers a subset of devices, with no explanation for gaps.
- Manual update logs presented as evidence of compliance.
- Inconsistent or conflicting information between evidence and self-assessment answers.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Confirmation that all anti-malware solutions are set to auto-update at least daily.
- Clear description of how updates are managed (centrally or per device).
- Evidence that matches the stated process and covers all relevant systems.

### Acceptable Responses
- "All company computers use [Vendor] Antivirus, which is set to auto-update signatures every 4 hours. See attached screenshots from three representative devices."
- "Our endpoint protection platform updates detection models automatically every 12 hours. Attached is a policy document and a screenshot from the admin console."
- "We use Windows Defender, which is configured via Group Policy to update signatures daily. See attached Group Policy screenshot and update logs."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We update antivirus when we remember."
- "Our IT person checks for updates weekly."
- "We believe updates are automatic, but we have no evidence."
- "Some computers update automatically, but we are unsure about the rest."
- "No evidence provided."

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide evidence for all device types in use (e.g., desktops, laptops, servers)?
- How do you ensure new devices are configured for auto-updates?
- If using non-signature-based solutions, how are detection mechanisms updated?
- Are there any exceptions (e.g., offline devices)? How are these managed?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), spot-checking a sample of devices may be sufficient if supported by a clear policy.
- For micro-businesses, a simple written procedure and a few screenshots may suffice.

### Resource Constraints
- Accept reasonable, practical evidence (e.g., screenshots, simple checklists) rather than enterprise-level reporting.
- Manual update processes are not acceptable unless justified by technical constraints and accompanied by compensating controls.

### Industry Context
- For organizations with devices that cannot connect to the internet (e.g., in manufacturing), require a documented process for manual updates and risk mitigation.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming default settings are sufficient without verification.
- Only updating some devices, not all.
- Relying on outdated or unsupported anti-malware solutions.

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots missing device identifiers or timestamps.
- Policies not reflecting actual practice.
- Evidence only for a subset of systems.

### False Positives
- Stating "auto-update enabled" without proof.
- Providing vendor brochures instead of actual configuration evidence.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence that all anti-malware solutions are set to auto-update at least daily?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is the evidence recent, device-specific, and covers all relevant systems?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on scope/gaps).

3. **Are there any exceptions or gaps?**
   - **No:** PASS.
   - **Yes:** Assess if exceptions are justified and managed; otherwise, Partial Compliance or FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional information.
- If technical limitations are cited, escalate to senior auditor for risk assessment.
- If organization cannot provide evidence after follow-up, FAIL.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same evidence and frequency standards across all organizations.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- For similar organizations, ensure similar types and quality of evidence are accepted.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and comprehensive evidence that all anti-malware solutions are set to auto-update at least daily. Responses lacking evidence, relying on manual updates, or covering only part of the environment should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the requirement for daily (or more frequent) automatic updates. Escalate unclear cases and ensure consistent application of these criteria.
