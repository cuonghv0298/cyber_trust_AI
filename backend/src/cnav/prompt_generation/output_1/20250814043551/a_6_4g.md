---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4g  
**Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software**  
**Provision Requirement:** Automatic lock/session log out should be enabled after 15 minutes of inactivity for user sessions on laptops, servers, non-mobile devices, databases, and administrator portals.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must configure all relevant IT assets (laptops, desktops, servers, databases, admin portals) to automatically lock or log out user sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity. This setting should be applied consistently across all applicable devices and systems.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access to unattended devices or sessions.
- Reduce risk of data breaches from unattended, unlocked systems.
- Enforce a baseline of secure configuration across the organization.

**Context & Importance:**  
Unattended, unlocked sessions are a common vector for internal and external threats. Enabling automatic session lock/log out is a simple, effective control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in resource-constrained environments.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization confirms that automatic lock/session log out is enabled after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity on **all** relevant assets: laptops, desktops, servers, databases, and admin portals.
- Evidence (e.g., screenshots, configuration policies) is provided for at least a representative sample of each asset type.
- The setting is enforced centrally (e.g., via group policy) or documented as part of standard operating procedures for all users.

### FAIL Criteria
- The organization does **not** have automatic lock/session log out enabled, or the inactivity period exceeds 15 minutes.
- The setting is only applied to some assets, with no plan or justification for exceptions.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated, outdated, or irrelevant.
- The organization is unaware of the requirement or claims it is "not applicable" without valid justification.

### Partial Compliance
- The setting is enabled on most, but not all, relevant assets (e.g., only on laptops, not on servers or admin portals).
- The inactivity timeout is set slightly above 15 minutes (e.g., 20 minutes) with a reasonable explanation and a plan to remediate.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some asset types.
- The organization is in the process of rolling out the setting and provides a clear, time-bound plan for full compliance.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of system settings showing session timeout/lockout configuration (for each asset type).
- Group policy or configuration management documentation.
- Written IT policy or SOP referencing the 15-minute inactivity lockout.
- Sample user communication or training materials referencing this control.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (dated within the last 12 months).
- Screenshots should clearly show the relevant setting and device/system name.
- Policies should be organization-specific, not generic templates.
- Evidence should cover all relevant asset types or provide a valid justification for any exclusions.

### Red Flags
- Screenshots or documents with missing or obscured details.
- Evidence referencing only one device or user.
- Policies that are generic, undated, or not implemented in practice.
- Claims of compliance without any supporting evidence.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Explicit confirmation that the 15-minute (or less) inactivity lock/session log out is enabled.
- Mention of all relevant asset types (laptops, desktops, servers, databases, admin portals).
- Evidence that the setting is enforced, not just recommended.

### Acceptable Responses
- "Yes, all laptops, desktops, and servers are configured to lock after 15 minutes of inactivity via group policy. See attached screenshots and policy document."
- "Session timeout is set to 15 minutes for our admin portal and database. Attached are screenshots from the admin console."
- "We use a standard operating procedure requiring all users to enable this setting. Attached is the SOP and sample screenshots from user devices."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "No, we do not have this setting enabled."
- "Only some users have this setting; we are not sure about the rest."
- "We rely on users to lock their screens manually."
- "We do not have evidence but believe it is enabled."
- "Not applicable" without a valid, documented justification.

### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide screenshots or documentation for all relevant asset types?"
- "How is this setting enforced across the organization (e.g., group policy, manual configuration)?"
- "Are there any exceptions? If so, please explain and justify."
- "When was this setting last reviewed or updated?"

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), evidence from each device may not be practical; a sample plus a written policy/SOP is acceptable.
- For organizations with only a few devices, manual configuration is acceptable if documented and consistently applied.

### Resource Constraints
- Centralized enforcement (e.g., group policy) is ideal but not mandatory for small organizations; manual settings are acceptable if consistently applied and evidenced.
- Free or built-in OS features (e.g., Windows/Mac auto-lock) are sufficient.

### Industry Context
- For organizations with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance), stricter enforcement may be expected.
- For organizations with no servers or admin portals, a clear statement and evidence of asset inventory is required.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only laptops/desktops are configured; servers, databases, or admin portals are overlooked.
- Timeout is set longer than 15 minutes.
- Reliance on user behavior rather than enforced settings.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated screenshots or policies.
- Evidence only covers a single device or user.
- Lack of documentation for manual processes.

### False Positives
- Policy exists but is not implemented in practice.
- Evidence is generic or from internet sources, not organization-specific.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is the 15-minute (or less) inactivity lock/session log out enabled on all relevant assets?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to evidence check.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is there credible, current evidence for each asset type?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial or FAIL (depending on scope and explanation).

3. **Are there any exceptions?**
   - **No:** PASS.
   - **Yes:** Are they justified and documented?
     - **Yes:** Partial (with plan to remediate).
     - **No:** FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is incomplete or ambiguous, request additional documentation.
- If the organization claims exceptions, escalate to senior auditor for review.
- If there are signs of fabricated or misleading evidence, escalate immediately.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Ensure that evidence is organization-specific and covers all relevant asset types.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, organization-specific evidence that all relevant devices and systems are configured to automatically lock or log out after 15 minutes of inactivity. Responses should be supported by current, credible documentation or screenshots. Partial compliance may be accepted with a clear, time-bound remediation plan. Consistency and practicality should guide the assessment, with reasonable accommodations for small organizations, but without compromising the security objective.
