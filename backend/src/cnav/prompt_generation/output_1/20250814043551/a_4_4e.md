# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4e  
**Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Protect from malicious software like viruses and malware**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**
- For all in-scope devices and environments (mobile devices, IoT devices, cloud platforms, web browsers, and email clients), the organization must implement appropriate anti-malware protections:
  - **Mobile Devices:** Must have anti-malware solutions installed and running.
  - **IoT Devices:** Must have anti-malware integrated, where feasible (e.g., CCTV, smart TVs, printers, digital locks).
  - **Cloud Environments:** Must have anti-malware deployed on the cloud platform.
  - **Web Browsers/Email Clients:** Must use only fully supported software with security controls, anti-phishing/spam filtering, unnecessary plugins/extensions disabled/removed, and web filtering deployed where feasible.

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Prevent, detect, and mitigate malware infections across all relevant platforms.
- Reduce risk of phishing, spam, and malicious web content.
- Ensure only secure, supported software is used for critical business functions.

**Context/Importance:**
- Malware is a leading cause of breaches, especially via email, web browsing, and vulnerable devices.
- Baseline anti-malware controls are essential to protect organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Mobile Devices:** All in-scope mobile devices have anti-malware installed, running, and regularly updated.
- **IoT Devices:** Anti-malware is integrated where technically feasible, or compensating controls are documented for devices where anti-malware cannot be installed.
- **Cloud:** Anti-malware is deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., endpoint protection for virtual machines, cloud-native security tools).
- **Web/Email:** Only supported browsers/email clients are used; anti-phishing and spam filtering are enabled; unnecessary plugins/extensions are removed; web filtering is in place or justified if not feasible.
- **Controls are documented and evidence is provided for each relevant environment.**

### FAIL Criteria
- No anti-malware present on in-scope devices/environments.
- Use of unsupported browsers/email clients without security controls.
- No anti-phishing/spam filtering or web filtering, with no justification.
- Lack of evidence or vague, unsubstantiated claims.

### Partial Compliance
- Some, but not all, in-scope devices/environments are protected.
- Anti-malware is present but not running or not updated.
- Web filtering or anti-phishing is only partially implemented.
- Organization provides a plan for remediation but has not yet implemented controls.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots or reports showing anti-malware installed and running on mobile devices.
- Device inventory lists with anti-malware status.
- Screenshots/configurations of IoT devices showing anti-malware or compensating controls.
- Cloud platform security dashboards or settings showing anti-malware deployment.
- Lists of approved browsers/email clients; screenshots of security settings.
- Evidence of anti-phishing/spam filtering and web filtering (e.g., admin console screenshots, policy documents).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).
- Evidence must clearly show device names, software versions, and status.
- Documentation must match the organization’s stated scope and inventory.

### Red Flags
- Generic statements without supporting evidence.
- Outdated screenshots or reports.
- Evidence that does not match the described environment (e.g., showing anti-malware on one device only).
- Evidence of unsupported or end-of-life software in use.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### **Question: Are website-whitelisting controls implemented (employees can only visit whitelisted sites)?**

#### What to Look For
- Description of web filtering or whitelisting technology in use.
- Evidence of web filtering policy or configuration.
- Explanation if whitelisting is not feasible, with alternative controls described.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “We use [web filtering solution] to restrict access to approved websites. See attached screenshot of policy settings.”
- “All employees access the internet via a secure gateway with whitelisting enabled. See evidence.”
- “Web filtering is not feasible due to [business reason], but we have implemented DNS filtering and anti-phishing controls as compensating measures.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We trust employees to avoid bad sites.”
- “No controls in place, but we plan to implement soon.”
- “We use Chrome/Edge but have not configured any web filtering.”

#### Follow-up Questions
- Which web filtering or whitelisting solution is used? Is it centrally managed?
- How often are the whitelists/filters reviewed and updated?
- Are there exceptions, and how are they managed?
- If not implemented, what compensating controls are in place?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), simple solutions (e.g., built-in browser controls, basic endpoint security suites) may be acceptable if they provide equivalent protection.
- Manual processes may be acceptable if documented and consistently applied.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means using built-in security features or affordable third-party solutions.
- If a control is not feasible (e.g., IoT device cannot support anti-malware), compensating controls (e.g., network segmentation, monitoring) must be documented.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, retail) may have unique IoT devices; feasibility of anti-malware must be considered.
- Cloud environments may differ (IaaS vs SaaS); ensure controls are appropriate for the service model.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking mobile or IoT devices in scope.
- Assuming built-in browser/email security is sufficient without configuration.
- Not disabling unnecessary browser/email plugins.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence only for a subset of devices.
- Screenshots without context (e.g., no device name, date).
- Policies not reflecting actual practice.

### False Positives
- Claiming “all devices protected” but only showing evidence for one.
- Relying solely on default settings without verification.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are all in-scope devices/environments identified?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Is anti-malware (or compensating control) implemented and evidenced for each?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Are web/email controls (supported software, anti-phishing, web filtering) implemented and evidenced?**
   - If NO → FAIL
4. **Is evidence current, complete, and credible?**
   - If NO → FAIL
5. **If all above are YES → PASS**

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional information.
- If compensating controls are claimed, escalate to senior auditor for review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and implementation across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

**Summary:**  
Use these criteria to systematically assess whether the organization’s self-assessment and evidence demonstrate adequate, practical, and proportionate implementation of anti-malware and web/email security controls across all relevant platforms. Ensure that controls are not only claimed but are evidenced, current, and appropriate for the organization’s size and context.
