            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4g  
**Provision Requirement:** Hardware and software assets that are unauthorised or have reached their respective EOS (End of Support) shall be replaced.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must identify all hardware and software assets in use, determine if any are unauthorised or have reached end-of-support (EOS), and ensure such assets are replaced or upgraded in a timely manner.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent use of unsupported or unauthorised hardware/software, which are more vulnerable to security threats.
- Ensure all assets receive security updates and vendor support.
- Reduce risk of compromise due to unpatched vulnerabilities.

**Context & Importance:**  
Unsupported or unauthorised assets are a common entry point for attackers. This provision ensures organizations maintain a secure, up-to-date IT environment, even with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization demonstrates awareness of the EOS status of all operating systems (and, where relevant, other critical software/hardware).
- There is a defined and implemented process for monitoring EOS status (e.g., periodic checks, vendor notifications).
- There is a clear, actionable process for replacing or upgrading EOS or unauthorised assets.
- Evidence shows recent or ongoing replacement/upgrade actions if EOS assets were identified.

### FAIL Criteria
- The organization is unaware of the EOS status of its assets.
- No process exists for monitoring EOS status.
- No plan or process for replacing/upgrading EOS or unauthorised assets.
- Evidence shows continued use of EOS/unauthorised assets with no mitigation or replacement plan.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization is aware of EOS status but the process for monitoring or replacement is informal, ad hoc, or incomplete.
- Some assets have been replaced, but others remain unsupported with no clear timeline for remediation.
- Evidence is insufficient or unclear; further clarification is needed.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Asset inventory or list showing OS/software versions and support status.
- Documentation of monitoring process (e.g., checklists, calendar reminders, assigned responsibilities).
- Records of recent upgrades/replacements (e.g., purchase orders, upgrade logs).
- Screenshots or reports showing current OS/software versions.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Asset lists should be reasonably complete for the organization’s size.
- Processes should be documented, even if simple (e.g., a checklist or email reminders).

### Red Flags
- Outdated asset lists or evidence (older than 12 months).
- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.
- Evidence that does not match the organization’s described environment.
- Evidence of continued use of EOS/unauthorised assets with no action plan.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: Do you know whether the OS used is already end-of-support? If yes, what is the process of replacing/upgrading?

**What to Look For:**
- Confirmation that the organization checks OS support status.
- Description of how EOS is determined (e.g., vendor website, IT provider).
- Clear process for replacement/upgrade (who, when, how).

**Acceptable Responses:**
- “We maintain a list of all computers and their OS versions. We check Microsoft’s website quarterly for EOS dates. If an OS is EOS, we schedule an upgrade within 1 month.”
- Evidence: Asset list, upgrade schedule, recent upgrade records.

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- “We don’t know if our OS is supported.”
- “We only upgrade when something breaks.”
- No evidence or outdated asset list.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- How often do you check for EOS status?
- Who is responsible for monitoring and upgrading?
- Can you provide a recent example of an upgrade?

---

### Q2: Is anyone monitoring whether the OS in use is no longer supported by the vendor (e.g., Microsoft)?

**What to Look For:**
- Assignment of responsibility (named person or role).
- Description of monitoring method (manual check, IT provider, automated tool).
- Frequency of monitoring.

**Acceptable Responses:**
- “Our office manager checks OS support status every 6 months using vendor websites.”
- “Our IT vendor notifies us of EOS dates and recommends upgrades.”

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- “No one is responsible.”
- “We don’t monitor this.”
- “We assume our systems are supported.”

**Follow-up Questions:**
- How do you ensure monitoring happens regularly?
- What steps are taken if an EOS asset is found?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet and periodic manual check is acceptable.
- Larger organizations should have more formalized processes.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual processes are acceptable if documented and performed regularly.
- Outsourcing to an IT provider is acceptable if responsibilities are clear.

### Industry Context
- Organizations in regulated sectors may need stricter controls.
- Non-IT-intensive sectors may have fewer assets but must still comply.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Asset lists are incomplete or not maintained.
- No regular process for checking EOS status.
- EOS assets remain in use without a plan for replacement.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is outdated or generic.
- No proof of recent monitoring or upgrades.

### False Positives
- Stating “we are compliant” without evidence.
- Listing assets but not showing support status or monitoring process.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence of an up-to-date asset inventory with OS/support status?**
   - If YES, continue. If NO, FAIL.
2. **Is there a documented process for monitoring EOS status?**
   - If YES, continue. If NO, FAIL.
3. **Is there evidence of timely replacement/upgrade of EOS or unauthorised assets?**
   - If YES, PASS. If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (if a plan is in place but not yet completed).
4. **Is responsibility for monitoring assigned and acted upon?**
   - If YES, PASS. If NO, FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation.
- If organization claims compliance but cannot provide evidence, escalate to senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across similar organizations.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear evidence that the organization knows the EOS status of its assets, monitors this regularly, and replaces/updates unsupported or unauthorised assets in a timely manner. Processes can be simple but must be documented and followed. Lack of awareness, process, or evidence should result in a FAIL. Partial compliance may be accepted if there is a clear, time-bound plan for remediation.
