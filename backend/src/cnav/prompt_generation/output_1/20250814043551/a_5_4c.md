# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4c  
**Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must have a documented and consistently applied process for granting and revoking access to its data and services. This process must include necessary approvals (e.g., manager or HR sign-off) and be triggered by personnel changes such as onboarding, role changes, or departures. The process must capture, at minimum, the following information for each access request or change:

- Name of the individual
- System to be accessed
- Department
- Role/account type
- From date (start of access)
- To date (end of access, if applicable)

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure only authorized individuals have access to sensitive systems and data.
- Prevent unauthorized access due to oversight or lack of process.
- Enable timely revocation of access when staff leave or change roles.

**Context/Importance:**  
Access control is a foundational security measure. Without a formal process, organizations risk data breaches from former employees or inappropriate access by current staff. This provision ensures accountability and traceability in access management, even in small or resource-limited organizations.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- There is a documented process (policy, SOP, or workflow) for granting and revoking access, including necessary approvals.
- The process is applied during onboarding, role changes, and offboarding.
- Access requests/changes are recorded with all required fields (name, system, department, role/account type, from date, to date).
- Evidence shows the process is in use (e.g., completed forms, approval emails, access logs).

### FAIL Criteria
- No documented process exists, or process lacks required approvals.
- Process does not cover both granting and revoking access.
- Required fields are missing from records.
- No evidence of process being followed (e.g., only verbal confirmation, no records).
- Access is granted/revoked informally (e.g., via chat, without record or approval).

### Partial Compliance
- Process exists but is inconsistently applied (e.g., only for some systems or staff).
- Some, but not all, required fields are captured.
- Evidence is incomplete or outdated.
- Approvals are informal or not documented.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Access control policy or documented procedure (can be simple, e.g., a one-page SOP).
- Sample access request/approval forms or emails (redacted if necessary).
- Access logs or records showing required fields.
- Evidence of recent onboarding/offboarding with completed process.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Must show actual use, not just templates.
- Approvals should be traceable (e.g., manager/HR sign-off).
- All required fields must be present in at least some records.

### Red Flags
- Only policy documents, no operational evidence.
- Evidence is outdated or generic (e.g., blank forms).
- Missing approvals or incomplete records.
- Evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent with organization size/structure.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: Is there a formal process (with approvals) to grant and revoke access?

**What to Look For:**
- Description of a step-by-step process.
- Mention of who approves access (e.g., manager, HR).
- Evidence of process being followed (forms, emails, logs).

**Acceptable Responses:**
- "We use an access request form that must be approved by the department head. When staff leave, HR notifies IT to revoke access. See attached sample forms and approval emails."
- "Access is granted via email request to IT, with manager approval required. Records are kept in a shared folder. See attached redacted samples."

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- "We just tell IT when someone needs access."
- "There is no formal process, but we try to remember to remove access when people leave."
- No evidence provided.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "Can you provide a recent example of an access request and approval?"
- "How do you ensure access is revoked when staff leave?"

---

### Q2: Is there an access-control policy?

**What to Look For:**
- Existence of a written policy or SOP (even if brief).
- Policy describes approval and record-keeping requirements.
- Policy covers both granting and revoking access.

**Acceptable Responses:**
- "See attached access control policy, which outlines the approval process and required information."
- "Our SOP (attached) describes how access is managed for new hires and leavers."

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- "We don't have a written policy."
- "Policy only covers granting, not revoking, access."
- Policy is generic and not tailored to organization.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "When was this policy last reviewed or updated?"
- "How is the policy communicated to staff?"

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet or email trail is acceptable if it captures all required fields and approvals.
- The process can be manual, but must be documented and consistently applied.

### Resource Constraints
- Accept simple, low-tech solutions (e.g., email approvals, shared folders) if they meet the requirements.
- Do not require enterprise-level tools or automated systems.

### Industry Context
- For regulated sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance), expect more formal processes.
- For micro-businesses, flexibility is allowed, but minimum fields and approvals must still be present.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Missing revocation process (focus only on granting access).
- Incomplete records (missing required fields).
- No evidence of approvals.

### Documentation Issues
- Only templates provided, no completed examples.
- Outdated or irrelevant evidence.

### False Positives
- Policy exists but is not followed in practice.
- Evidence is staged or not representative of actual operations.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented process or policy for access control?**
   - No → FAIL
   - Yes → Continue

2. **Does the process require approvals for granting/revoking access?**
   - No → FAIL
   - Yes → Continue

3. **Are all required fields (name, system, department, role/account type, from/to dates) captured in records?**
   - No → Partial/FAIL (depending on extent)
   - Yes → Continue

4. **Is there evidence the process is used for onboarding, role changes, and offboarding?**
   - No → Partial/FAIL
   - Yes → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, escalate to senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If organization claims process is "in progress," mark as FAIL but provide guidance for remediation.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a documented, consistently applied process for access control, with necessary approvals and records capturing all required fields. Evidence must show actual use, not just intent. Flexibility is allowed for small organizations, but minimum standards must be met. Incomplete, informal, or undocumented processes should result in a FAIL or request for remediation.
