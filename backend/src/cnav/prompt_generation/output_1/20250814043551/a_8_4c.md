---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4c  
**Clause:** Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline  
**Provision:** For non-business-critical systems or non-essential information, the backups should still be performed but at/on a lower frequency/long term basis.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that, in addition to backing up essential data, they also back up non-business-critical systems or non-essential information. However, these backups can be performed less frequently (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or as appropriate) and/or retained for longer periods, reflecting their lower criticality.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent data loss from affecting non-essential systems, which may still be needed for compliance, reference, or recovery.
- Ensure organizational resilience by maintaining the ability to restore less critical data if needed.
- Reduce risk of total data loss due to ransomware, accidental deletion, or hardware failure.

**Context & Importance:**  
While essential data is prioritized, non-essential data can still be important for audits, legal requirements, or operational continuity. Even infrequent backups help organizations recover from broader incidents and demonstrate a mature approach to data management.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Organization demonstrates that backups of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information **are performed**, even if at a lower frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually).
- There is a **defined schedule or policy** for these backups, even if informal.
- Evidence shows that at least one backup of non-essential data has been performed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within the past year).
- The backup process is **documented** or can be described clearly by the organization.

### FAIL Criteria
- Organization does **not perform any backups** of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information.
- No evidence or description of backup activities for non-essential data.
- Organization claims non-essential data does not require backup without justification.
- Backups are only performed for business-critical data, with non-essential data ignored.

### Partial Compliance
- Organization has **ad hoc** or irregular backups of non-essential data, but no defined schedule or process.
- Backups are performed, but not stored offline or not retained for a reasonable period.
- Organization is in the process of implementing such backups but has not yet completed the process.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some non-essential systems.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Backup schedules, policies, or procedures (even if informal or in email/notes).
- Backup logs, screenshots, or reports showing non-essential data backups.
- Inventory/list of non-business-critical systems with backup status.
- Statements from IT staff describing the backup process for non-essential data.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last 12 months).
- Should clearly indicate **which systems/data** are considered non-essential and how/when they are backed up.
- Evidence must be **specific** (not generic statements like "we back up everything").

### Red Flags
- Vague or blanket statements with no supporting detail.
- Evidence only covers business-critical data.
- Outdated backup logs (older than 12 months).
- No mention of non-essential data in backup documentation.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear identification of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information.
- Description of backup frequency (e.g., "we back up these systems quarterly").
- Evidence of at least one backup event for non-essential data.
- Any policy, schedule, or process—even if informal—covering non-essential data.

### Acceptable Responses
- "We back up our archived email and old project files quarterly to an external hard drive stored offsite."
- "Non-essential systems are backed up monthly; see attached backup logs for [system name]."
- "Our backup policy (attached) specifies that non-critical data is backed up every six months."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We only back up business-critical data."
- "Non-essential data is not backed up because it is not important."
- "We do not have a backup process for non-business-critical systems."
- "All data is backed up, but we cannot provide evidence for non-essential data."

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide an example of a recent backup of non-essential data?
- How do you determine which systems/data are non-essential?
- Where are these backups stored, and how often are they performed?
- Is there any documentation or log showing the last backup of non-essential data?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, informal processes (e.g., manual copying to USB drives) are acceptable if performed and documented.
- Backup frequency can be lower (e.g., annually) if justified by data criticality and resource constraints.

### Resource Constraints
- "Reasonable effort" means at least some non-essential data is backed up, even if infrequently.
- Automated solutions are not required; manual backups are acceptable.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., legal, healthcare) may have regulatory requirements for retaining non-essential data; auditors should consider this.
- For organizations with minimal non-essential data, a clear rationale for backup frequency is acceptable.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming non-essential data does not need any backup.
- No distinction between essential and non-essential data in backup processes.
- Backups performed but not stored offline or not retained.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence for non-essential data backups.
- Outdated or incomplete backup logs.
- Policies that mention only business-critical data.

### False Positives
- Statements like "all data is backed up" without evidence for non-essential data.
- Evidence of backup software in use, but no indication of scope or frequency for non-essential data.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the organization perform backups of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

2. **Is there evidence (logs, schedules, statements) showing these backups occur, even at a lower frequency?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance (if process is being implemented)
   - **Yes:** Proceed

3. **Is the backup process for non-essential data defined (even informally) and has at least one backup occurred in the last 12 months?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request more evidence or clarification)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims exemption from backing up non-essential data without clear justification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for size and sector as outlined above.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that non-essential data is backed up at a lower frequency, with at least one backup event in the past year. Informal processes are acceptable for small organizations, but there must be some documentation or credible description. Lack of any backup for non-essential data, or inability to provide evidence, should result in a FAIL.
