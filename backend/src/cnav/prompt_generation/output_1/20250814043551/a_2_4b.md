# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4b  
**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  
**Provision: Hardware asset inventory must include all relevant device types, including servers, network devices, laptops, computers, and, if in scope, company-issued mobile devices and IoT devices.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all hardware assets within the certification scope. This includes, at a minimum, servers, network devices, laptops, and computers. If the organization uses company-issued mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) or IoT devices (e.g., CCTV, smart printers, smart TVs), these must also be included in the asset inventory.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all hardware assets are known, tracked, and can be protected.
- Reduce risk of unmanaged or unknown devices introducing vulnerabilities.
- Enable effective incident response and asset management.

**Context & Importance:**  
Untracked devices are a common entry point for attackers. A complete asset inventory is foundational for all other security controls (patching, access control, etc.), especially for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The asset inventory **explicitly lists** all relevant hardware types in use: servers, network devices, laptops, computers.
- If company-issued mobile devices are used, they are **included** in the inventory.
- If IoT devices are present, they are **included** in the inventory.
- The inventory is **current** (updated within the last 12 months or as devices are added/removed).
- The inventory is **accessible** and used for security management.

### FAIL Criteria
- The inventory **omits** any relevant device category in use (e.g., mobile devices or IoT devices present but not listed).
- The inventory is **outdated** or clearly incomplete.
- The organization **cannot produce** an inventory or only provides a partial/informal list.
- The inventory is **generic** (e.g., "laptops: yes") without specific device identification.

### Partial Compliance
- The inventory lists most but not all device types (e.g., includes laptops and servers but omits mobile devices that are in use).
- The inventory is present but lacks sufficient detail (e.g., device types listed but not models or identifiers).
- The organization is in the process of updating the inventory but cannot demonstrate current completeness.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Asset inventory document** (spreadsheet, asset management tool export, or written list).
- **Screenshots** of inventory systems or registers.
- **Sample device labels** or photos (if used for tracking).
- **Policy or procedure** describing how inventory is maintained (optional but supportive).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Inventory should be **dated** and show recent updates.
- Device entries should be **specific** (e.g., "Dell Latitude 5420 laptop, S/N 12345").
- All relevant device categories should be **represented**.
- Evidence should be **consistent** with the organization's size and operations.

### Red Flags
- Inventory is undated or last updated over a year ago.
- Inventory only lists device types, not actual devices.
- Inventory omits obvious device categories (e.g., mobile devices for a sales team).
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical entries, inconsistent formatting).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:
**Does the asset inventory include all types of hardware in use, such as servers, network devices, laptops, computers, mobile devices and IoT devices?**

#### What to Look For
- **Explicit mention** of each device type relevant to the organization.
- **Evidence** that the inventory is maintained and up-to-date.
- **Inclusion** of mobile and IoT devices if these are used.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "Yes, our asset inventory includes all servers, network switches, laptops, desktops, company-issued mobile phones, and CCTV cameras. See attached spreadsheet dated [recent date]."
- "We use a Google Sheet to track all hardware assets, including laptops, desktops, WiFi routers, and iPads issued to staff. Screenshot attached."
- "Our inventory is updated quarterly and includes all IT and IoT devices in the office."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We have a list of laptops and desktops, but mobile devices are not tracked."
- "We only track computers; network devices and IoT devices are not included."
- "We do not have an asset inventory."
- "We only have a list from two years ago."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Are there any company-issued mobile devices or tablets in use? If so, please provide evidence they are included in the inventory."
- "Do you use any IoT devices (e.g., smart TVs, CCTV, smart printers)? If so, are they tracked?"
- "When was the inventory last updated?"
- "How do you ensure new devices are added to the inventory?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or written list is acceptable if it covers all device types.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized tracking (e.g., asset management software).

### Resource Constraints
- Manual inventories are acceptable if they are complete and maintained.
- No requirement for automated tools, but inventory must be **comprehensive**.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., retail, healthcare) may have more IoT devices—ensure these are not overlooked.
- Remote/hybrid organizations may have more mobile devices; ensure these are included.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Failing to include mobile or IoT devices that are in use.
- Inventory is only created for the audit, not maintained in practice.
- Inventory lists device types, not actual devices.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated inventories.
- Lack of evidence for claimed device types.
- Inconsistent or incomplete device details.

### False Positives
- Responses that claim "all devices are tracked" but provide no evidence or only partial lists.
- Inventories that are too generic to be actionable.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the inventory exist and is it current?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Does it include all relevant device types in use (servers, network devices, laptops, computers, and, if applicable, mobile and IoT devices)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Is the inventory sufficiently detailed and credible?**
   - If NO → Partial Compliance or FAIL (seek clarification)
4. **Is evidence provided and does it match the organization's operations?**
   - If YES to all above → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If the inventory is incomplete or unclear, request additional evidence or clarification.
- If there is evidence of deliberate omission or fabrication, escalate to senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
A PASS requires a current, comprehensive, and credible inventory of all hardware assets in scope, including mobile and IoT devices if used. Evidence must be provided and match the organization's actual operations. Partial or incomplete inventories, or lack of evidence, should result in FAIL or further investigation. Adjust expectations for organization size and sector, but do not compromise on the requirement for completeness and currency.
