---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4e  
**Clause: Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software**  
**Provision: Automatic connection to open networks and auto-run feature of non-essential programs (other than backup or anti-malware solution, etc.) shall be disabled.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that:
- Devices do **not** automatically connect to open (unsecured) wireless networks.
- The auto-run (or auto-play) feature for non-essential programs (e.g., USB drives, CDs, external applications) is **disabled** on all systems, except for essential security or backup software.

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Prevent unauthorized access or malware infection via automatic connections to insecure networks.
- Block malware or unwanted software from executing automatically when external media is connected.

**Context & Importance:**  
Auto-connecting to open networks and auto-running programs are common attack vectors for malware and unauthorized access. Disabling these features is a fundamental, low-cost way to reduce risk, especially for organizations with limited IT resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Automatic connection to open (unsecured) networks is disabled** on all organization devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices).
- **Auto-run/auto-play for non-essential programs is disabled** on all endpoints, except for explicitly justified exceptions (e.g., backup or anti-malware solutions).
- The organization can **demonstrate** these settings are in place (via screenshots, policy documents, or configuration reports).
- Staff are **aware** of these restrictions (e.g., via policy, training, or communication).

### FAIL Criteria
- Devices are allowed to auto-connect to open networks by default.
- Auto-run/auto-play is enabled for non-essential programs or external media.
- No evidence or only verbal assurance is provided.
- Exceptions are made without clear justification or documentation.

### Partial Compliance
- Some devices are compliant, but others are not (e.g., only office PCs, not laptops or mobiles).
- Settings are applied, but not enforced or regularly checked.
- Evidence is incomplete, outdated, or only covers a subset of devices.
- Organization is in the process of implementing but not yet complete.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Screenshots** of device/network settings showing auto-connect and auto-run disabled.
- **Configuration reports** from endpoint management tools or group policy settings.
- **Written policies** or procedures referencing these controls.
- **Staff communications** or training materials mentioning these requirements.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be **current** (within the last 6 months).
- Should cover **all relevant device types** (PCs, laptops, mobiles).
- Must be **specific** (e.g., actual screenshots, not generic images).
- If using policies, must show **implementation**, not just intent.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not device-specific.
- Only policy documents provided, with no proof of implementation.
- Screenshots or reports are incomplete or edited.
- No mention of mobile devices if they are in use.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear statement that both auto-connect to open networks and auto-run for non-essential programs are disabled.
- Evidence that settings are applied across all devices.
- Justification for any exceptions (e.g., backup software).
- Awareness or communication to staff.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We have disabled auto-connect to open networks on all laptops and mobile devices. Auto-run is disabled via group policy on all Windows PCs. See attached screenshots and policy excerpt.”
- “All endpoints are managed via [tool], which enforces these settings. Attached is a configuration report and screenshot from a sample device.”
- “Our IT policy (attached) requires these settings, and we have verified compliance as per the attached checklist.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We tell staff not to connect to open networks, but do not enforce it.”
- “Auto-run is disabled on some PCs, but not all.”
- “We don’t have evidence, but we believe it’s disabled.”
- “We allow auto-run for convenience.”

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide screenshots or reports from a sample of devices?
- How do you ensure new devices are configured with these settings?
- Are mobile devices included in this control?
- How often are these settings reviewed or checked?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), manual checks and screenshots from each device are acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect centralized enforcement (e.g., group policy, MDM).

### Resource Constraints
- Manual configuration is acceptable if no management tools are available, provided evidence is shown.
- Written procedures or checklists are acceptable if formal policies are not feasible.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with field staff or mobile devices must include these in scope.
- Sectors with high use of removable media (e.g., design, engineering) must show controls are applied.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking mobile devices or BYOD.
- Assuming default settings are secure.
- Not disabling auto-run for all types of external media.

### Documentation Issues
- Only providing policy, not proof of implementation.
- Screenshots from a single device only.
- Outdated evidence.

### False Positives
- Responses that state intent but lack evidence.
- Evidence from test or non-production devices.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are both auto-connect to open networks and auto-run for non-essential programs disabled on all devices?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Is there credible, current evidence covering all device types?**
   - **No** → FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Are exceptions justified and documented?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes/Not Applicable** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or only partially covers the environment, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and implementation across all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, current, and comprehensive evidence that both auto-connect to open networks and auto-run for non-essential programs are disabled on all relevant devices, with any exceptions justified. Responses lacking evidence, omitting device types, or relying solely on policy without proof should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but require reasonable demonstration of compliance.
