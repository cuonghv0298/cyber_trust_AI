# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.1.4d  
**Clause: Assets: People – Equip employees with know-how to be the first line of defence**  
**Provision: Where feasible, the training content should be differentiated based on the role of the employees (senior management/business leaders vs. employees).**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must, where feasible, provide cybersecurity training that is tailored to the roles of their staff. This means:
- **Senior management/business leaders** should receive training relevant to their responsibilities (e.g., fostering a cybersecurity culture, setting strategy, understanding risk).
- **General employees** should receive practical training (e.g., using strong passwords, device protection, recognizing phishing).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all staff are equipped to act as the first line of defence against cyber threats.
- Promote a culture of cybersecurity awareness at all organizational levels.
- Address the different risk profiles and responsibilities of management vs. general staff.

**Context/Importance:**  
Role-based training ensures that both leadership and staff understand their unique responsibilities and risks, reducing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This is a foundational control for organizations with limited resources, as people are often the weakest link in cybersecurity.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides evidence that cybersecurity training is differentiated by role (at least two groups: management and employees).
- Training content for **senior management** includes topics such as cybersecurity culture, strategy, or risk management.
- Training content for **employees** covers practical security measures (e.g., password hygiene, device security, phishing awareness).
- The differentiation is reasonable and proportionate to the organization's size and structure.
- If the organization is very small (e.g., <5 staff), a clear rationale is provided for combined or simplified training, with evidence that all relevant topics are covered.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of differentiated training by role.
- Only generic, undifferentiated training is provided to all staff, with no mention of management-specific content.
- Training is missing for either management or employees.
- The organization claims differentiation but provides no supporting evidence or details.

### Partial Compliance
- Some differentiation is described, but evidence is incomplete or unclear (e.g., only one group’s training is documented).
- The organization is very small and provides a plausible explanation for combined training, but the content does not cover both management and employee needs.
- Evidence is outdated or not clearly linked to current staff roles.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Training materials (slides, agendas, handouts) showing different content for management and employees.
- Attendance records or sign-in sheets indicating which staff attended which training.
- Training schedules or communications specifying role-based sessions.
- Policy documents or emails outlining the training approach.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the past 12 months).
- Materials should clearly indicate differentiation (e.g., “Management Training Agenda” vs. “Employee Training Agenda”).
- Attendance or completion records should map to staff roles.

### Red Flags
- Vague descriptions of training with no supporting materials.
- Outdated evidence (older than 12 months).
- Evidence that is generic or templated, not tailored to the organization.
- No proof that management received any training distinct from employees.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Explicit mention of different training content or sessions for management and employees.
- Evidence that management topics (culture, strategy, risk) are covered.
- Evidence that employee topics (passwords, device security, phishing) are covered.
- For small organizations, a rationale for combined training and confirmation that all topics are addressed.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We conduct annual cybersecurity training. Senior management attends a session on cybersecurity strategy and risk, while employees attend a session on password security and phishing. See attached agendas and attendance lists.”
- “As a 4-person company, we conduct a single training session covering both management and employee topics. See attached training slides and attendance record.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “All staff receive the same cybersecurity training” (with no mention of management-specific content).
- “We provide cybersecurity training” (with no details or evidence).
- “Management is aware of cybersecurity” (with no proof of training or content).

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide examples of the training materials used for management vs. employees?
- How do you ensure that management receives training relevant to their responsibilities?
- For small organizations: How do you ensure both management and employee topics are covered in your training?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), combined training is acceptable if all relevant topics are covered and the rationale is documented.
- For larger organizations, clear role-based differentiation is expected.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or low-cost training resources are acceptable if they are relevant and role-appropriate.
- Training does not need to be formal or externally delivered, but must be documented and role-appropriate.

### Industry Context
- For sectors with specific risks (e.g., healthcare, finance), training should reference relevant threats, but baseline differentiation is still required.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming generic training is sufficient for all roles.
- Overlooking management’s need for strategic/cultural training.
- Failing to update training content regularly.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence for management training.
- Outdated or irrelevant training materials.
- No attendance or completion records.

### False Positives
- Claiming differentiation but providing only one set of training materials.
- Using off-the-shelf training with no adaptation for roles.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence of differentiated training for management and employees?**
   - **Yes:** Go to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Does the evidence show management topics (culture, strategy, risk) and employee topics (practical security)?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Go to 3.

3. **Is the organization very small, with a documented rationale for combined training that covers all topics?**
   - **Yes:** PASS or PARTIAL (if some topics are missing).
   - **No:** FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If the organization claims constraints due to size, verify that all topics are still addressed.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is uncertainty about what constitutes reasonable differentiation for the organization’s context.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document reasons for PASS, FAIL, or PARTIAL decisions.
- Ensure that evidence is recent, relevant, and clearly linked to staff roles.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that cybersecurity training is differentiated by role, or—where not feasible for very small organizations—that all relevant topics are covered in a combined session. Responses lacking detail, evidence, or role-specific content should be marked as FAIL. Always consider the organization’s size and resource constraints, but do not compromise on the requirement that both management and employees are equipped with appropriate cybersecurity know-how.
