# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4a  
**Secure/Protect: Access control – Account management and inventory**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must establish and maintain an up-to-date inventory of all user accounts that have access to their systems, data, and services. This includes accounts for workstations, servers, and, where applicable, personal devices used to access organizational resources. The inventory can be managed using simple tools such as spreadsheets or by exporting lists from directory services (e.g., Active Directory, Google Workspace).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure only authorized individuals have access to organizational resources.
- Enable prompt identification and removal of unnecessary or risky accounts.
- Reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to forgotten, orphaned, or unmanaged accounts.

**Context and Importance:**  
Account management is a foundational control for preventing unauthorized access and limiting the impact of compromised credentials. For resource-constrained organizations, a simple, well-maintained account inventory is a practical and effective baseline measure.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization maintains a current, documented inventory of all login accounts for workstations and servers.
- The inventory includes all relevant accounts (e.g., staff, contractors, service accounts).
- The inventory is updated regularly (at least quarterly or when staff changes occur).
- If personal devices are used to access organizational networks, there is a list of these devices and associated users.
- The process for updating and reviewing the account inventory is described and evidence is provided.

### FAIL Criteria
- No account inventory exists, or the organization cannot produce one.
- The inventory is clearly outdated (e.g., contains ex-employees, missing new hires).
- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only covers some systems, omits personal devices used for access).
- No process exists for maintaining or updating the inventory.

### Partial Compliance
- An inventory exists but is missing some elements (e.g., only covers workstations, not servers or personal devices).
- The inventory is not regularly updated, or the update process is unclear.
- Evidence is insufficient to confirm the inventory is current or complete.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Account inventory list (spreadsheet, export from directory service, etc.).
- Documentation or description of the process for updating and reviewing the inventory.
- Screenshots or exports from account management tools (if used).
- For personal devices: a list or register of devices and users.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be dated within the last 3–6 months.
- The inventory should clearly identify accounts by user, system, and (if applicable) device.
- The process documentation should be clear and actionable.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated or obviously outdated.
- Inventory lists are incomplete or generic (e.g., only showing “admin” or “user”).
- No evidence of regular review or update.
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., template lists with no real data).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: What is the current process for reporting a stolen or lost corporate device?
- **What to Look For:** Description of a process that includes disabling or reviewing accounts associated with lost/stolen devices.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “When a device is reported lost, IT disables the user account and removes it from the inventory.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “We don’t have a process,” or “We just tell the manager.”
- **Follow-up Questions:** “How do you ensure accounts linked to lost devices are removed or disabled?”

### Q2: Is there a permanent office location?
- **What to Look For:** Not directly related to account inventory, but may affect how devices and accounts are managed.
- **Acceptable Responses:** Clear statement of office location or remote-only status.
- **Unacceptable Responses:** Unclear or contradictory answers.
- **Follow-up Questions:** “How does your office setup affect account management?”

### Q3: Is there a list of login accounts for all workstations and servers?
- **What to Look For:** Existence of a comprehensive, current list.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, we maintain a spreadsheet/export from Active Directory updated monthly. Here is a sample.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No,” “Not sure,” or “We rely on memory.”
- **Follow-up Questions:** “Can you provide a recent copy of the account list?”

### Q4: Does the organization maintain a list of personal devices used to access its networks?
- **What to Look For:** A register of personal devices and associated users.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, we have a BYOD register updated quarterly.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No,” “We don’t track personal devices.”
- **Follow-up Questions:** “How do you ensure only authorized personal devices are allowed?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or even a documented list is acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized inventories and processes.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual processes are acceptable if they are documented and consistently applied.
- Automated tools are not required but may be used.

### Industry Context
- Organizations in regulated sectors may have stricter requirements; however, Cyber Essentials baseline applies to all.
- Remote or hybrid organizations must account for personal devices and remote access.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Inventory only covers some systems (e.g., desktops but not servers).
- No tracking of personal devices used for work.
- Inventory not updated after staff changes.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is outdated or missing.
- Inventory is not clearly linked to actual users or devices.

### False Positives
- Organization claims to have an inventory but cannot produce it.
- Inventory is a template, not a real, populated list.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a current, documented inventory of all login accounts for workstations and servers?**
   - If YES, proceed.
   - If NO, FAIL.

2. **Is the inventory complete and regularly updated?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, request clarification or additional evidence.

3. **Are personal devices tracked if they access organizational resources?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, FAIL or partial compliance (depending on context).

4. **Is the process for maintaining the inventory described and evidenced?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, request further information.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate a current, complete, and regularly updated inventory of all accounts (and personal devices, if applicable), with a clear process for maintenance. Evidence must be credible and recent. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept the absence of any account management process.
