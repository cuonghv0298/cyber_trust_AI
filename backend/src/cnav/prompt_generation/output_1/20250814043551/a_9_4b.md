# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.9.4b  
**Clause: Respond: Incident response – Be ready to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents**  
**Provision Requirement:** The incident response plan shall be made aware to all employees in the organisation that have access to the organisation’s IT assets and/or environment.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
All employees who have access to the organization’s IT assets or environment must be made aware of the incident response plan. This means employees should know:
- That an incident response plan exists,
- Their role or responsibility in the event of an incident,
- How to report incidents, and
- Where to find or access the plan if needed.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure rapid and coordinated response to cybersecurity incidents.
- Minimize damage and recovery time by ensuring all relevant staff know what to do.
- Reduce risk of incidents going unreported or mishandled due to lack of awareness.

**Context/Importance:**  
Awareness is critical for effective incident response. Even a well-written plan is ineffective if employees are unaware of its existence or their responsibilities. This is especially important for organizations with limited IT resources, as every staff member may play a key role in early detection and response.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides clear evidence that all employees with IT access have been informed about the incident response plan.
- There is a defined process or method for communicating the plan (e.g., onboarding, periodic training, email notifications, staff meetings).
- The organization can demonstrate that awareness activities have occurred within the last 12 months.
- Employees know how to report incidents and where to find the plan.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence or only vague statements that employees are aware of the plan.
- Awareness is limited to IT staff or management, not all relevant employees.
- No process or ad-hoc communication (e.g., “We tell them if something happens”).
- No recent awareness activities or evidence is outdated.

### Partial Compliance
- Some, but not all, employees have been made aware.
- Awareness activities are informal or one-off with no ongoing process.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of staff.
- The process is described but not implemented or evidenced.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Records of staff communications (e.g., emails, memos, meeting minutes).
- Training materials or attendance logs.
- Onboarding checklists referencing incident response awareness.
- Screenshots of intranet posts or staff portals.
- Staff acknowledgement forms or e-signatures.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be dated and cover all relevant staff.
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Evidence should clearly reference the incident response plan.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated or generic (e.g., “We tell staff verbally”).
- Only policy documents are provided, with no proof of communication.
- Evidence only covers a subset of employees (e.g., IT team only).
- Evidence is fabricated or appears inconsistent (e.g., identical signatures, missing dates).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**Are all employees aware of the incident response plan? How do you make sure?**

#### What to Look For
- Description of how awareness is achieved (e.g., training, onboarding, regular reminders).
- Evidence that all relevant employees (not just IT) are included.
- Specifics on frequency and method of communication.
- Reference to reporting procedures and access to the plan.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “All staff receive incident response training during onboarding, and we conduct annual refresher sessions. Attendance logs are attached.”
- “We send an annual email to all employees with a summary of the incident response plan and reporting instructions. Sample email and distribution list attached.”
- “The incident response plan is posted on our staff intranet, and all employees are required to acknowledge reading it. Screenshot and acknowledgement records provided.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We have an incident response plan and staff can ask IT if they have questions.”
- “Only IT staff are aware of the plan.”
- “We told everyone about it last year, but have no records.”
- “The plan is available if someone wants to read it.”

#### Follow-up Questions
- How do you ensure new employees are made aware of the plan?
- When was the last time staff were reminded or trained on the incident response plan?
- Can you provide evidence that all relevant staff have received this information?
- How do you verify that staff understand their responsibilities in an incident?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal methods (e.g., documented team meetings, group emails) may be acceptable if all staff are covered and evidence is provided.
- For larger organizations, more formal processes (e.g., training logs, HR onboarding checklists) are expected.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means using practical, low-cost methods (e.g., email, short briefings) but must be documented.
- One-off communications are acceptable if all staff are covered and evidence is recent.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with high staff turnover (e.g., retail, F&B) should show how new joiners are made aware.
- Organizations with remote or shift workers should demonstrate inclusive communication methods.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming policy existence equals awareness.
- Only informing IT or management, not all staff with IT access.
- No ongoing process for new joiners or refresher communications.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of dated evidence.
- No proof of communication to all relevant staff.
- Evidence only covers a subset of employees.

### False Positives
- Policy documents presented as evidence of awareness without proof of communication.
- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Did the organization provide evidence that ALL employees with IT access are made aware of the incident response plan?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Is the evidence recent (within 12 months) and does it cover all relevant staff?**
   - **No** → Partial Compliance or FAIL (seek clarification)
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is there a defined, repeatable process for ensuring ongoing awareness (e.g., onboarding, annual reminders)?**
   - **No** → Partial Compliance (recommend improvement)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or only partially covers staff, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If there are signs of fabricated or inconsistent evidence, escalate to a senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Use follow-up questions to clarify ambiguous responses before making a final decision.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and comprehensive evidence that all employees with IT access are made aware of the incident response plan, using practical and proportionate methods. Lack of evidence, limited coverage, or outdated communications should result in a FAIL or request for further information.
