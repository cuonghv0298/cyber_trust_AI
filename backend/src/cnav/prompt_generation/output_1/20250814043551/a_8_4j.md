# Evaluation Prompt for A.8.4j
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.8.4j

            ## Provision ID
            A.8.4j

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**
- The organization must perform longer-term (e.g., monthly) backups of essential data.
- These backups must be stored **offline** (i.e., not connected to the main network or internet) in an **external, secure storage location**.
- Acceptable storage media include password-protected USB flash drives, encrypted external hard disks, or tape storage.
- The storage location should ideally be physically separate from the main office (e.g., an alternative office or secure offsite location).

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Ensure that critical data can be recovered in the event of ransomware, cyberattack, or physical disaster.
- Prevent backups from being compromised if the main network is breached.
- Reduce risk of data loss due to single-point-of-failure or simultaneous compromise.

**Context/Importance:**
- Offline, offsite backups are a fundamental defense against ransomware and catastrophic incidents.
- This provision is especially important for organizations with limited IT resources, as it provides a simple, effective recovery option.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Organization confirms that longer-term (e.g., monthly) backups are performed.
- Backups are stored **offline** (not connected to the network/internet when not in use).
- Backups are kept in a **secure external location** (e.g., locked cabinet, alternative office, or secure offsite facility).
- Storage media are **protected** (e.g., password-protected, encrypted).
- Evidence (e.g., backup logs, photos, inventory lists) supports the claim.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of offline backups being performed.
- Backups are only stored online, on network-attached storage, or in cloud services without offline copies.
- Storage media are not protected (e.g., unencrypted, no password).
- Backups are kept in the same physical location as the primary data without additional security.
- No supporting evidence provided.

### Partial Compliance
- Backups are performed and stored offline, but security controls (encryption/password) are weak or inconsistently applied.
- Storage location is not clearly external or secure.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Backup schedules or logs indicating monthly/offline backups.
- Photos of backup devices (with identifying labels, if possible).
- Inventory lists of backup media and storage locations.
- Written procedures or policies describing backup and storage practices.
- Receipts or documentation for offsite storage services (if used).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 3-6 months).
- Documentation should be specific (e.g., dates, device types, storage locations).
- Photos or logs should not reveal sensitive data but should demonstrate actual practice.

### Red Flags
- Vague statements without supporting documentation.
- Evidence is outdated or generic (e.g., template policies not tailored to the organization).
- Photos or logs appear staged or inconsistent with described practices.
- No mention of security controls (encryption/passwords) on backup media.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Confirmation of **monthly** (or longer-term) backup frequency.
- Description of **offline** storage (e.g., "USB drive is disconnected and locked away after backup").
- Details of **external, secure location** (e.g., "stored in a locked cabinet at manager’s home/alternative office").
- Mention of **security controls** (e.g., password protection, encryption).

### Acceptable Responses
- "We perform monthly backups of our essential data to an encrypted external hard drive, which is stored in a locked cabinet at our director’s home."
- "Backups are made to a password-protected USB drive, which is kept offsite at our accountant’s office."
- Evidence: Backup logs showing monthly entries, photos of labeled backup devices, inventory lists, or written backup procedures.

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We back up to Google Drive/OneDrive" (cloud-only, not offline).
- "Backups are stored on a network drive in the office" (not offline or external).
- "We have a USB backup, but it stays plugged into the server" (not offline).
- No evidence or only generic policy statements.

### Follow-up Questions
- Where exactly are the backup devices stored when not in use?
- Are the backup devices encrypted or password-protected?
- Who has access to the backup storage location?
- Can you provide a recent backup log or photo of the backup device and storage location?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, it is acceptable for backups to be stored at a trusted staff member’s home, provided the device is secured (locked, password-protected/encrypted).
- The process should be simple but must meet the offline and security requirements.

### Resource Constraints
- Use of affordable encrypted USB drives or external hard disks is sufficient.
- No need for enterprise-grade solutions, but basic security (password/encryption, physical security) is required.

### Industry Context
- For organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance), stronger encryption and stricter access controls may be expected.
- For low-risk sectors, basic password protection and physical security may suffice.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Backups are performed but not stored offline or offsite.
- Devices are not secured (no password/encryption).
- Only cloud backups are used, with no offline copy.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence for actual backup practice (e.g., no logs, no photos).
- Outdated or generic policies not reflecting current practice.

### False Positives
- Responses that mention "backups" but do not specify offline, external, or secure storage.
- Claims of "secure" storage without describing controls or location.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are longer-term backups performed?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Are backups stored offline (disconnected from network/internet)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Are backups stored in an external, secure location?**
   - If NO → FAIL
4. **Are backup devices protected (password/encryption)?**
   - If NO → Partial Compliance (request clarification); if YES → proceed
5. **Is there credible, recent evidence supporting the above?**
   - If NO → Partial Compliance (request evidence); if YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting documentation, escalate for further review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and sector.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, credible evidence that longer-term backups are performed, stored offline, and kept in a secure, external location with appropriate protection. Responses lacking these elements, or without supporting evidence, should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the core requirements of offline, secure, and external backup storage.
