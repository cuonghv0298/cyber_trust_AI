# Evaluation Prompt for A.4.4d
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.4.4d

            ## Provision ID
            A.4.4d

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that their anti-malware (antivirus) solution is configured to automatically scan files whenever they are accessed. This includes files and attachments that are:
- Downloaded from the Internet (via web browsers or email)
- Received from external sources (e.g., USB drives, external hard disks)

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent malware infections by detecting threats at the point of file access, before execution or further distribution.
- Reduce the risk of malware spreading via common vectors (email, web downloads, removable media).

**Why This Is Important:**  
Automatic, real-time scanning is a fundamental defense against malware. It ensures that threats are detected and blocked before they can cause harm, especially in organizations with limited cybersecurity expertise.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has an anti-malware solution installed on all relevant endpoints (workstations, laptops, servers).
- The anti-malware solution is configured to automatically scan files upon access (real-time/on-access scanning is enabled).
- The configuration covers files from all major sources: web downloads, email attachments, and external/removable media (e.g., USB drives).
- Evidence provided (e.g., screenshots, configuration reports) clearly shows real-time/on-access scanning is enabled.

### FAIL Criteria
- No anti-malware solution is in place, or it is not installed on all relevant devices.
- Real-time/on-access scanning is disabled or not configured.
- The solution only performs manual or scheduled scans, not automatic scans upon file access.
- Evidence is missing, insufficient, or contradicts the self-assessment response.

### Partial Compliance
- Real-time scanning is enabled on some, but not all, devices.
- Only certain file sources (e.g., web downloads) are covered, but not others (e.g., USB drives).
- The organization claims compliance but cannot provide adequate supporting evidence.
- The anti-malware solution is outdated or unsupported.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of anti-malware settings showing real-time/on-access scanning enabled.
- Configuration reports or policy documents from the anti-malware solution.
- Device inventory showing anti-malware deployment status.
- (Optional) Screenshots or logs showing detection of test files from different sources (web, email, USB).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).
- Screenshots must clearly show the device name, anti-malware product, and relevant settings.
- Reports must be unaltered and directly from the anti-malware solution.

### Red Flags
- Generic statements without evidence (“We have antivirus installed”).
- Outdated screenshots or reports.
- Evidence from only one device when multiple are in use.
- Evidence that does not clearly show real-time/on-access scanning.
- Evidence from unsupported or consumer-grade solutions in a business context.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Confirmation that real-time/on-access scanning is enabled.
- Coverage of all relevant endpoints and file sources.
- Evidence that matches the organization’s IT environment.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Our anti-malware solution (e.g., Windows Defender, Sophos, McAfee) is installed on all computers. Real-time scanning is enabled, as shown in the attached screenshots from several devices. The settings show that files from web downloads, email, and USB drives are automatically scanned upon access.”
- Screenshots showing “Real-time protection: ON” or similar wording.
- Configuration reports listing “on-access scanning: enabled.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We run antivirus scans every week” (scheduled/manual only).
- “We have antivirus installed” (no mention of real-time/on-access scanning).
- No evidence provided, or evidence does not show relevant settings.
- Evidence only from a single device when the organization has multiple endpoints.

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide evidence from additional devices or platforms (if applicable)?
- How do you ensure that real-time scanning remains enabled (e.g., policy, periodic checks)?
- Are all types of files and sources (web, email, USB) covered by the scanning configuration?
- What is your process for updating or replacing anti-malware solutions?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), evidence from all devices may be requested.
- For larger organizations, a representative sample (e.g., 10-20%) may suffice if device types are consistent.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or built-in anti-malware solutions (e.g., Windows Defender) are acceptable if properly configured.
- Complex enterprise solutions are not required, but basic real-time protection must be in place.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with high USB usage (e.g., manufacturing, logistics) should pay particular attention to external device scanning.
- Sectors handling sensitive data may require stricter evidence of coverage.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Real-time scanning enabled only on some devices.
- USB/external device scanning not enabled.
- Staff can disable real-time scanning without oversight.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is outdated or from test environments.
- Screenshots do not show relevant settings.
- Reports are incomplete or redacted.

### False Positives
- Responses that mention “antivirus is installed” but do not address real-time/on-access scanning.
- Evidence from personal devices instead of business endpoints.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is anti-malware installed on all relevant devices?**
   - No → FAIL
   - Yes → Continue

2. **Is real-time/on-access scanning enabled and configured to scan files from web, email, and USB?**
   - No → FAIL
   - Yes → Continue

3. **Is sufficient, recent, and credible evidence provided?**
   - No → FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)
   - Yes → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims technical limitations, verify if reasonable alternatives are in place.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same evidence and configuration standards across all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that real-time/on-access scanning is enabled on all relevant devices, covering files from all major sources. Responses must be supported by credible documentation or screenshots. Resource-appropriate solutions are acceptable, but the core requirement—automatic scanning upon file access—must be met for a PASS.
