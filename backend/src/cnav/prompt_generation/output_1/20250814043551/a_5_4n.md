# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4n  
**Clause: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision Requirement: The account password shall be changed in the event of any suspected compromise.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that whenever there is a suspicion or confirmation that an account password has been compromised (e.g., through phishing, malware, or unauthorized access), the password for that account is promptly changed. This should be reflected in the organization’s password policy and operational procedures.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent continued unauthorized access after a compromise.
- Limit the window of opportunity for attackers.
- Ensure compromised credentials are rendered useless as soon as possible.

**Context & Importance:**  
Password compromise is a common attack vector. Promptly changing passwords upon suspicion of compromise is a fundamental, low-cost, high-impact control that significantly reduces risk, especially for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization’s password policy **explicitly states** that passwords must be changed immediately upon suspected or confirmed compromise.
- There is a **clear, actionable process** for identifying and responding to suspected password compromise.
- Staff are **aware** of this requirement (e.g., through training or policy dissemination).
- Evidence (if provided) supports that this process is in place and has been communicated.

### FAIL Criteria
- The password policy **does not mention** password changes in the event of compromise.
- The organization’s response is vague, generic, or only references periodic password changes (e.g., “we change passwords every 90 days”).
- No process or awareness of what to do in the event of a suspected compromise.
- No evidence or only irrelevant evidence provided.

### Partial Compliance
- The policy mentions password changes but **only after confirmed compromise**, not suspicion.
- The process is informal or ad-hoc (e.g., “we tell IT if something seems wrong” without documented steps).
- The organization relies solely on users to self-report without any supporting guidance or reminders.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Password policy document or excerpt.
- Incident response or access control procedures referencing password resets.
- Staff communications or training materials mentioning password change requirements.
- Screenshots of policy documents, intranet pages, or email communications.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be **current** (within the last 12 months).
- Policy/procedure must **explicitly reference** password changes upon suspected compromise.
- Evidence should be **organization-specific** (not generic templates).

### Red Flags
- Outdated policies (older than 12 months, or no review date).
- Generic policy templates with no customization.
- Evidence that only covers routine password changes, not compromise scenarios.
- No evidence provided when requested.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**IT: Does the password policy account for the password reset of a compromised account?**

#### What to Look For
- Direct reference in the policy to password resets upon suspected or confirmed compromise.
- Description of how staff are made aware of this requirement.
- Evidence that the process is known and actionable.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “Our password policy states that any account suspected of being compromised must have its password changed immediately. This is communicated to all staff during onboarding and in our annual security refresher.”
- “If we suspect an account has been compromised, our IT support resets the password and notifies the user. This is outlined in our access control procedure (see attached excerpt).”
- Attached policy document with a highlighted section: “In the event of suspected compromise, the password must be changed immediately.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We change passwords every 90 days.”
- “We don’t have a formal process, but staff know to tell IT if something is wrong.”
- “We have never had a compromise, so this is not applicable.”
- No supporting evidence or only a generic password policy with no mention of compromise.

#### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide the section of your policy that covers password changes after suspected compromise?”
- “How are staff informed of what to do if they suspect their account is compromised?”
- “When was the last time this process was reviewed or communicated to staff?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple, clearly communicated process (e.g., an email to all staff outlining the steps) is acceptable if formal documentation is not feasible.
- The key is that **all staff know what to do** and that the process is actionable.

### Resource Constraints
- A basic written policy or procedure is sufficient; complex technical solutions are not required.
- Evidence of communication (e.g., a staff memo or onboarding checklist) is acceptable.

### Industry Context
- For sectors with higher risk (e.g., finance, healthcare), expect more formalization.
- For low-risk sectors, a simple, clear process is acceptable as long as it meets the intent.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Policy only covers routine password changes, not compromise scenarios.
- Over-reliance on informal or verbal processes.
- Staff are unaware of what to do in case of suspected compromise.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated or generic policies.
- No evidence of staff awareness or communication.

### False Positives
- Policy mentions “password changes” but not specifically in response to compromise.
- Evidence provided is a template with no organization-specific details.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the policy/procedure explicitly require password change upon suspected compromise?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is there evidence that this requirement is communicated and actionable (e.g., staff awareness, process steps)?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial compliance; request clarification or additional evidence.

3. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial compliance or FAIL depending on severity.

### Escalation Criteria
- If the response is ambiguous, lacks evidence, or appears to be a template, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and sector.
- Document rationale for decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must have a policy or process that explicitly requires password changes upon suspected compromise, and there must be evidence that this is known and actionable by staff. Routine password changes or informal processes are insufficient. Evidence must be current, organization-specific, and clearly demonstrate compliance with the provision.
