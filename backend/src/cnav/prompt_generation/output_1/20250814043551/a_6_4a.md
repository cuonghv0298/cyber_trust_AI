# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4a  
**Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must enforce secure configuration settings on all key IT assets, including desktop computers, servers, and network devices (e.g., routers). This means default settings should be changed, unnecessary services disabled, and security features enabled according to recognized best practices (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, vendor guidelines). The approach can be manual or automated, and may use tools, scripts, or checklists.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce attack surface by disabling unused features/services.
- Prevent exploitation of default or weak configurations.
- Ensure consistent baseline security across all devices.

**Why This Is Important:**  
Default configurations are often insecure and widely known to attackers. Secure configuration is a foundational control that prevents many common attacks, especially for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Documented Approach:** Organization describes a clear, repeatable process for securing configurations (e.g., following CIS, vendor, or government guidelines).
- **Scope:** Applies to all relevant assets (desktops, servers, routers, wireless access points).
- **Implementation Evidence:** Evidence shows secure settings are enforced (e.g., screenshots, configuration files, tool output).
- **Maintenance:** There is a process for reviewing and updating configurations (even if basic/manual).

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of secure configuration practices.
- Default settings are used without justification.
- No mention of disabling unnecessary services or changing default credentials.
- No process for reviewing or updating configurations.

### Partial Compliance
- Some assets are secured, but others are not (e.g., desktops secured, but routers left default).
- Process exists but is informal or inconsistently applied.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of assets.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedures/checklists for secure configuration.
- Screenshots of configuration settings (e.g., disabled guest accounts, changed default passwords).
- Output from security tools (e.g., baseline analyzers, configuration scripts).
- Network diagrams showing device types and security controls.
- Inventory lists indicating configuration status.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Should cover all relevant asset types.
- Must be specific (generic statements or templates are insufficient).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated or not asset-specific.
- Screenshots or documents are clearly copied from the internet or other organizations.
- No evidence for critical assets (e.g., routers, servers).
- Contradictions between responses and evidence.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### **Who manages your computer network? Is there a network diagram?**
- **What to Look For:** Named responsible person/team; up-to-date network diagram showing all key assets.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Our IT vendor manages the network; see attached diagram showing desktops, server, router, WiFi AP."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "Not sure," "No diagram," or diagram missing key assets.
- **Follow-up Questions:** "When was the diagram last updated? Who reviews it?"

### **Is there a secondary DNS server available?**
- **What to Look For:** Awareness of redundancy and secure configuration.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Yes, we have a secondary DNS server configured as per vendor guidelines."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "No idea," "We use default settings."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How is the DNS server secured? Are default credentials changed?"

### **Does the company maintain a local server (on-premises) or use the cloud? Are staff allowed external access (e.g., from home)?**
- **What to Look For:** Description of server location and access controls.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "We use cloud servers with MFA; on-premises server has firewall and strong passwords."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "Anyone can access from anywhere," "No controls."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How are remote access settings secured? Are VPNs used?"

### **If external access is allowed, is there a VPN for personal devices or other wireless access points?**
- **What to Look For:** Use of secure remote access methods.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "VPN required for all remote access; default VPN settings changed."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "No VPN," "Default VPN settings used."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How are VPN credentials managed? Are logs reviewed?"

### **Are your wireless networks visible from outside the office? Is the SSID hidden?**
- **What to Look For:** Awareness and control of wireless network exposure.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "SSID is hidden; WPA2/WPA3 enabled; guest network separated."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "SSID is public; no password."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How often are wireless settings reviewed?"

### **If data is stored physically on-site, does the location have CCTV and security guards? Who has access?**
- **What to Look For:** Physical security controls for IT assets.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Server room is locked; access logged; CCTV covers entry."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "Anyone can enter," "No controls."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How is access to the server room managed?"

### **What other physical controls exist (e.g., visitor sign-in, employee access cards)?**
- **What to Look For:** Additional physical security measures.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Visitor logbook; access cards for staff."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "No controls."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How are lost access cards handled?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple checklist or manual process is acceptable if consistently applied.
- Network diagrams can be basic but must be accurate.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or built-in tools (e.g., Windows Security Baseline, router admin interface) are acceptable.
- Formal documentation not required, but clear evidence of action is.

### Industry Context
- Organizations in regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may need stricter controls.
- Retail/hospitality may have more wireless assets—ensure these are covered.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only desktops secured; routers and WiFi left with default settings.
- No process for reviewing configurations after initial setup.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not asset-specific.
- Missing screenshots or configuration files.

### False Positives
- Stating "we follow best practices" without evidence.
- Providing a network diagram but no proof of secure settings.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence of secure configuration for all key asset types?**
   - If YES → Go to 2.
   - If NO → FAIL.

2. **Is the evidence recent and specific to the organization?**
   - If YES → Go to 3.
   - If NO → Partial/FAIL.

3. **Is there a process for maintaining/reviewing configurations?**
   - If YES → PASS.
   - If NO → Partial/FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or only partially covers assets, escalate to senior auditor or request more evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, organization-specific evidence that secure configuration practices are in place and maintained for all key IT assets. Responses must go beyond generic statements and demonstrate practical, proportionate implementation. Where evidence is lacking or only partially covers the scope, further clarification or escalation is required.
