            A.4.4h

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**Provision Requirement:**  
As good practice, firewall configurations and rules should ideally be reviewed and verified annually to protect the organisation’s Internet-facing assets where applicable.

**Practical Explanation:**  
Organizations must review and verify the configuration and rules of their firewalls at least once every 12 months. This review should cover all Internet-facing firewalls (e.g., those protecting servers, cloud services, or office networks exposed to the Internet). The review aims to ensure that only necessary ports/services are open, rules are up-to-date, and no unauthorized changes have occurred.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce exposure to external threats by ensuring only required services are accessible.
- Detect and remediate misconfigurations or outdated rules that could be exploited.
- Maintain an up-to-date understanding of the organization’s network perimeter.

**Importance:**  
Firewalls are a primary defense against external attacks. Regular reviews help prevent attackers from exploiting forgotten or misconfigured rules, which is a common cause of breaches.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization states that firewall rules/configurations are reviewed at least annually (every 12 months or more frequently).
- The review includes all Internet-facing firewalls.
- There is evidence of the review process (e.g., logs, checklists, meeting notes, or change records).
- The review is documented and shows that findings are acted upon if issues are found.

### FAIL Criteria
- No review of firewall rules/configurations is conducted, or reviews are ad hoc/irregular (less than once per year).
- The organization cannot specify when the last review occurred.
- Only partial coverage (e.g., only some firewalls reviewed, or only after incidents).
- No evidence or documentation of reviews.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization reviews firewalls less frequently than annually (e.g., every 18 months).
- The review is informal or undocumented.
- Only some Internet-facing firewalls are included.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Review logs or records (e.g., checklist, signed-off document, ticketing system entry).
- Change management records showing firewall rule reviews.
- Meeting notes or emails referencing firewall rule review.
- Screenshots of review schedules or completed reviews.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be dated and clearly reference the firewall(s) in question.
- Should show that a review took place within the last 12 months.
- Should indicate what was reviewed and any actions taken.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated, generic, or not specific to firewall reviews.
- Evidence is older than 12 months.
- Evidence is fabricated (e.g., templates with no real data, or backdated documents).
- No mention of Internet-facing assets.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear statement of review frequency (e.g., “annually,” “every 6 months”).
- Description of what is reviewed (all Internet-facing firewalls).
- Evidence of the last review (date, scope, findings).
- Indication that reviews are scheduled or part of a process.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Firewall rules are reviewed annually. The last review was in March 2024, covering all Internet-facing firewalls. See attached checklist and meeting notes.”
- “We have a process to review firewall rules every 12 months. Attached is the change log from our last review in January 2024.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We review firewall rules when needed.”
- “No formal review process, but we check when there are issues.”
- “Not sure when the last review was.”
- “We don’t have any firewalls.” (If the organization has Internet-facing assets, this is a red flag.)

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide documentation or records of your last firewall rule review?”
- “Which firewalls are included in your review process?”
- “How do you ensure all Internet-facing assets are covered?”
- “What actions do you take if issues are found during the review?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple checklist or email record of the review is acceptable.
- If using managed services, confirmation from the provider that reviews are performed annually is sufficient.

### Resource Constraints
- The process does not need to be complex; a basic documented review is adequate.
- Automated firewall management tools or third-party reviews are acceptable if documented.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements, but Cyber Essentials only requires annual review as a baseline.
- Cloud-only organizations should review cloud firewall/security group rules.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Reviews are performed but not documented.
- Only internal (non-Internet-facing) firewalls are reviewed.
- Reviews are forgotten or performed less than annually.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is missing, outdated, or not specific to firewall reviews.
- Reliance on verbal confirmation without written records.

### False Positives
- Stating a review occurs without any supporting evidence.
- Confusing firewall rule changes with a comprehensive review.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented process or evidence showing firewall rules are reviewed at least annually?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Does the review cover all Internet-facing firewalls?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on scope).

3. **Is the evidence dated within the last 12 months and specific to firewall reviews?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims not to have Internet-facing assets, verify this claim.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for size and complexity as outlined above.
- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate (with evidence) that all Internet-facing firewall rules are reviewed at least annually, and that this review is documented. Accept simple, proportionate evidence for small organizations, but do not accept undocumented or ad hoc processes. Escalate unclear or suspicious cases for further review.
