# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4d  
**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  
**Provision: Software assets within the scope of certification may include software applications used by the organisation. If the scope of certification includes a cloud environment: Organisation shall include what is hosted on the cloud instances, e.g., software and Operating System (OS).**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
- The organization must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all software assets within the certification scope.  
- This inventory must include all software applications used by the organization, including those installed or hosted on cloud instances (e.g., SaaS, IaaS, PaaS).  
- For cloud environments, the inventory must specify what is hosted on each cloud instance, including both applications and operating systems.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure visibility and control over all software assets to reduce the risk of unmonitored or unauthorized software, which can be exploited by attackers.
- Enable effective patch management, vulnerability assessment, and incident response by knowing what software is in use and where it resides.

**Context and Importance:**  
- Untracked software, especially in cloud environments, is a common attack vector.
- Maintaining a comprehensive software inventory is foundational for all subsequent security controls (e.g., updates, access control).

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides a current, comprehensive software inventory covering all in-scope assets.
- The inventory explicitly lists software applications on both on-premises and cloud environments.
- For cloud instances, the inventory details what is hosted (applications and OS).
- The inventory is documented (e.g., spreadsheet, asset management tool export) and appears to be maintained (not a one-off or outdated list).

### FAIL Criteria
- The inventory omits cloud-hosted software or does not mention cloud environments where they are in use.
- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only lists on-premises software, or only major applications).
- No inventory is provided, or the response is purely verbal/unsupported.
- The inventory is clearly outdated (e.g., references obsolete systems, last updated over a year ago).

### Partial Compliance
- The inventory includes most, but not all, software assets (e.g., cloud applications are listed, but OS details are missing).
- The inventory is present but lacks sufficient detail (e.g., generic entries like “cloud apps” without specifics).
- The inventory is up-to-date but only covers a subset of the organization (e.g., only one department).

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Software asset inventory document (spreadsheet, asset management system export, or similar).
- Screenshots of asset management tools or cloud dashboards showing software listings.
- Policy or procedure describing how the inventory is maintained and updated.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be dated within the last 12 months (preferably within 6 months).
- The inventory should be specific: software names, versions, deployment locations (on-prem/cloud), and for cloud, the instance or service name.
- Evidence should be consistent with the organization’s size and IT environment.

### Red Flags
- Inventory lists only generic categories (e.g., “Office software”) without specifics.
- No mention of cloud assets when the organization uses cloud services.
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., template with no organization-specific details).
- Inventory is a static document with no indication of regular updates.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Confirmation that the inventory includes all applications, including those on cloud instances.
- Explicit mention of cloud-hosted software and OS, if cloud is in scope.
- Evidence that the inventory is maintained and updated regularly.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Our software inventory includes all applications used by the organization, including those hosted on AWS and Microsoft 365. See attached spreadsheet dated [recent date], listing all software and OS for each cloud instance.”
- “We use [asset management tool] to track all software, including cloud-hosted applications. Attached are screenshots showing our current inventory, including cloud VMs and their OS.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We keep a list of our main software, but cloud applications are managed by the provider.”
- “We only track on-premises software; cloud is out of scope.”
- “We do not have a formal inventory, but IT knows what we use.”
- No evidence provided, or evidence is clearly outdated.

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide a sample of your inventory showing both on-premises and cloud-hosted software?”
- “How often is your software inventory reviewed and updated?”
- “How do you ensure new cloud applications are added to the inventory?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or document listing all software (including cloud apps and OS) is acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect more structured inventories, possibly from asset management tools.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual inventories are acceptable if they are complete and regularly updated.
- Automated tools are not required but are a best practice for larger or more complex environments.

### Industry Context
- Organizations in sectors with heavy cloud reliance (e.g., SaaS businesses) must show clear cloud asset tracking.
- For organizations with minimal IT, ensure at least basic cloud services (e.g., email, file storage) are included.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking cloud-hosted software or assuming the provider is responsible for inventory.
- Only listing major or licensed software, omitting free or open-source tools.
- Inventory is created for the audit but not maintained in practice.

### Documentation Issues
- Inventory is undated or lacks version history.
- Evidence is a generic template, not organization-specific.
- Inventory does not distinguish between on-premises and cloud assets.

### False Positives
- Inventory lists cloud providers (e.g., “AWS”) but not what is actually hosted (applications, OS).
- Inventory includes only application names, omitting OS for cloud VMs.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented software inventory?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Continue

2. **Does the inventory include all in-scope applications, including those on cloud instances?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Continue

3. **For cloud environments, does the inventory specify what is hosted (applications and OS)?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial (if some details are present)
   - **Yes:** Continue

4. **Is the inventory current (updated within the last 12 months) and organization-specific?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If the inventory is incomplete or ambiguous, request additional evidence or clarification.
- If the organization claims not to use cloud but other evidence suggests otherwise, escalate for further review.
- For partial compliance, consult with a senior auditor to determine if remediation or additional evidence is required.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Ensure that evidence is organization-specific and not generic or templated.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS this provision, the organization must provide a current, comprehensive, and organization-specific inventory of all software assets, including those hosted on cloud instances (with details on applications and OS). Evidence must be credible, complete, and reflect actual practice, not just a one-off list for the audit. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept omission of cloud assets or outdated/incomplete inventories.
