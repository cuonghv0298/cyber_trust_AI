---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.3.4b  
**Clause: Assets: Data – Know what data the organisation has, where they are, and secure the data**  
**Provision: Review of the inventory list should be carried out at least annually, or whenever there is any change to the data captured by the organisation.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must maintain an up-to-date inventory of the data they hold, including what data exists and where it is stored. Critically, this inventory must be reviewed at least once per year, and also whenever there is a change to the data captured (e.g., new data types collected, data deleted, or storage locations changed).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure the organization is always aware of its data assets and their locations.
- Enable timely identification and protection of sensitive or critical data.
- Reduce the risk of data loss, unauthorized access, or regulatory non-compliance due to unknown or unmanaged data.

**Context/Importance:**  
Regular review of the data inventory is essential for maintaining visibility over organizational data, especially as business processes and data flows change. This is a foundational step for effective data protection and incident response.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization reviews its data inventory **at least once every 12 months**.
- The organization reviews the inventory **whenever there is a change** to the data captured (e.g., new data types, new storage locations, data deletions).
- The review process is **documented** (e.g., review logs, meeting notes, updated inventory lists with timestamps).
- The organization can **demonstrate awareness** of this requirement and provide evidence of recent reviews.

### FAIL Criteria
- The inventory is **not reviewed annually** (i.e., last review was over 12 months ago).
- The organization **cannot demonstrate** that reviews occur when data changes.
- There is **no documentation** or evidence of review activities.
- The organization is **unaware** of the need for periodic or change-driven reviews.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization reviews the inventory **less frequently than annually** (e.g., every 18 months).
- Reviews are conducted **ad hoc** but not systematically when data changes.
- Evidence is **incomplete** (e.g., only verbal confirmation, no supporting documentation).
- The process is **informal** or lacks clear records.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Inventory review logs** (manual or digital, showing review dates).
- **Meeting minutes** or emails referencing inventory reviews.
- **Updated inventory lists** with modification/review timestamps.
- **Change management records** indicating inventory updates after data changes.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **dated** and **traceable** to specific review events.
- Evidence should **clearly indicate** both periodic (annual) and event-driven (upon data change) reviews.
- Documentation should be **recent** (within the last 12 months) and **consistent** with the organization's stated review frequency.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is **undated** or lacks clear indication of review frequency.
- Inventory lists are **outdated** or have not been updated in over a year.
- Only **verbal assurances** or generic statements are provided.
- Evidence appears **fabricated** (e.g., identical review dates for multiple years, inconsistent details).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question: "How often is the inventory list being reviewed?"

#### What to Look For
- A **clear statement** of review frequency (e.g., "annually," "every 6 months," "after any data change").
- **Description of triggers** for ad hoc reviews (e.g., "whenever new data is collected or deleted").
- **Supporting evidence** as outlined above.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We review our data inventory every 12 months and whenever there is a change in the data we collect or store. The last review was conducted on [date], and we updated the inventory when we started using a new cloud service in [month/year]. See attached review log and updated inventory list."
- "Inventory reviews are scheduled annually in our IT calendar, and we also update the list when onboarding new systems. Attached are meeting notes from the last review and the updated inventory file."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We review the inventory when we remember to."
- "We haven't reviewed the inventory in over a year."
- "We don't keep a record of reviews."
- "We only update the inventory when there is a major change, but not on a regular basis."
- "No evidence provided."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide documentation or logs showing the last two inventory reviews?"
- "How do you ensure the inventory is updated when new data is collected or deleted?"
- "Who is responsible for conducting and recording inventory reviews?"
- "What triggers an ad hoc review outside the annual schedule?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For **very small organizations** (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or checklist with review dates is acceptable.
- The process can be **manual** but must be **consistent** and **documented**.

### Resource Constraints
- "Reasonable effort" means a **basic, repeatable process** (e.g., annual calendar reminder, simple log).
- No need for complex tools; **clarity and regularity** are key.

### Industry Context
- **Highly regulated sectors** (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more frequent or detailed reviews.
- For organizations with **minimal data assets**, the inventory and review process can be proportionately simple but must still meet the annual and change-driven review requirement.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Reviews are **claimed** but not **documented**.
- Inventory is **updated only when convenient**, not systematically.
- **No process** for reviewing after data changes.

### Documentation Issues
- **Missing or outdated** review logs.
- **No evidence** of ad hoc reviews after data changes.
- **Generic statements** without specifics.

### False Positives
- Inventory list is **current** but **no evidence** of regular review.
- **Template documents** with no real activity behind them.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence of an inventory review within the last 12 months?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Is there evidence that the inventory is reviewed/updated when data changes?**
   - **No** → FAIL or Partial Compliance (if annual review is strong)
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is the evidence credible, dated, and traceable?**
   - **No** → FAIL or Partial Compliance
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is **ambiguous, incomplete, or appears fabricated**, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional supporting documentation.
- If the organization claims compliance but **cannot provide any documentation**, escalate for further review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same **minimum evidence requirements** (dated review, evidence of change-driven updates) across all organizations.
- For similar organization sizes and sectors, ensure **uniform expectations** for what constitutes sufficient documentation and process rigor.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must provide clear, dated evidence of at least annual inventory reviews and demonstrate that reviews/updates occur when data changes. The process can be simple but must be documented and repeatable. Lack of documentation, infrequent reviews, or only ad hoc updates without a systematic process should result in a FAIL or, at best, Partial Compliance pending further evidence.
