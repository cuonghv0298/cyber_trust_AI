# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.7.4d  
**Update: Software updates – Update software on devices and systems (Mobile, IoT, Cloud)**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**
- **Mobile Devices:** Updates and patches must only be downloaded from trusted sources (e.g., official app stores, manufacturer’s update channels).
- **IoT Devices:** Any IoT device (e.g., CCTV, printers) that is no longer receiving software patches or updates must be removed or replaced.
- **Cloud Environments:**  
  - The organization must understand the cloud shared responsibility model (i.e., which party—organization or CSP—is responsible for updates/patches).
  - The organization must have visibility into updates/patches performed by the CSP.
  - The organization must define security requirements for software updates in its agreements with CSPs.

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Prevent introduction of malware or vulnerabilities via untrusted update sources.
- Ensure all devices remain protected against known vulnerabilities.
- Clarify and enforce update responsibilities in cloud environments to avoid unpatched exposures.

**Why This Is Important:**
- Unpatched devices are a leading cause of compromise.
- IoT and mobile devices are often overlooked in patch management.
- Cloud environments introduce shared responsibility, which, if misunderstood, can leave critical gaps.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Mobile:** Organization confirms updates/patches are only from official/manufacturer sources, with supporting evidence (e.g., policy, screenshots, device settings).
- **IoT:** Organization identifies IoT devices in use and demonstrates a process for removing/replacing devices that no longer receive updates.
- **Cloud:** Organization can explain the shared responsibility model for each cloud service, shows evidence of monitoring CSP updates, and has documented security requirements for updates in CSP agreements or policies.

### FAIL Criteria
- Updates for mobile devices are sourced from unofficial or unverified channels.
- IoT devices that are unsupported or unpatched remain in use with no plan for replacement.
- Organization is unaware of or cannot explain the cloud shared responsibility model.
- No evidence of monitoring CSP updates or defining update requirements for CSPs.

### Partial Compliance
- Organization has some, but not all, mobile/IoT/cloud assets covered.
- Processes are informal or ad hoc, with limited documentation.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the requirement.
- Further clarification or evidence is needed to confirm compliance.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Mobile:** Device management policy, screenshots of update settings, MDM configuration, staff communications.
- **IoT:** Asset inventory, records of device replacement, vendor support documentation, removal logs.
- **Cloud:** CSP agreements, shared responsibility documentation, update/patch notifications from CSP, internal policy referencing cloud update responsibilities.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Documentation should be specific to the organization’s environment.
- Screenshots or logs should clearly show relevant settings or actions.
- Policies should be formally approved or communicated.

### Red Flags
- Generic or templated policies with no organization-specific details.
- Outdated evidence (older than 12 months).
- Lack of asset inventory or incomplete device lists.
- No documentation of cloud responsibilities or CSP communications.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear identification of mobile, IoT, and cloud assets in scope.
- Explicit statements about update sources for mobile devices.
- Evidence of IoT device lifecycle management (removal/replacement).
- Understanding and documentation of cloud shared responsibility.
- Evidence of CSP update monitoring and requirements.

### Acceptable Responses
- “All mobile devices are configured to only accept updates from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. See attached MDM policy and screenshots.”
- “We maintain an IoT inventory. Devices no longer supported by the vendor are decommissioned—see attached removal log.”
- “Our cloud provider is AWS. We have reviewed the AWS shared responsibility model (see attached document), and our contract specifies patching requirements. We receive monthly update reports from AWS.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We update devices when we remember.”
- “We use whatever update source is available.”
- “We have IoT devices but don’t know if they’re still supported.”
- “We use cloud services but are not sure who is responsible for updates.”
- No supporting evidence provided.

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide a list of all mobile/IoT/cloud assets in use?
- How do you verify that IoT devices are still receiving updates?
- Can you show a recent example of a CSP update notification or report?
- Where is the shared responsibility model documented for your cloud services?
- How do you ensure staff only use official app stores for updates?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple documented process and basic evidence (e.g., screenshots, email communications) are acceptable.
- Asset inventories can be spreadsheets or simple lists.
- Formal contracts with CSPs may be replaced by documented acceptance of standard CSP terms if custom contracts are not feasible.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means using built-in device settings, vendor notifications, and basic asset tracking.
- Manual processes are acceptable if consistently applied and documented.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with high IoT usage (e.g., retail, healthcare) may need more robust IoT management.
- Organizations using only SaaS cloud services may have limited update responsibilities but must still understand the shared responsibility model.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking IoT devices (e.g., printers, cameras).
- Assuming CSP handles all updates without verification.
- Using unofficial app stores or sideloading apps on mobile devices.

### Documentation Issues
- No asset inventory or incomplete lists.
- Policies not tailored to actual practices.
- Evidence not dated or not organization-specific.

### False Positives
- Stating “we always update” without specifying sources or providing evidence.
- Listing cloud providers but not addressing shared responsibility or update monitoring.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are mobile devices only updated via trusted sources?**
   - Yes, with evidence → PASS
   - No, or unclear → FAIL

2. **Are unsupported/unpatched IoT devices removed or replaced?**
   - Yes, with evidence → PASS
   - No, or unclear → FAIL

3. **Is the cloud shared responsibility model understood and documented?**
   - Yes, with evidence of monitoring and requirements → PASS
   - No, or unclear → FAIL

4. **Is evidence current, specific, and credible?**
   - Yes → PASS
   - No → FAIL

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request clarification or additional documentation.
- If the organization claims not to use mobile, IoT, or cloud assets, verify this claim with asset inventories.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is a dispute over what constitutes “trusted sources” or “visibility” in cloud environments.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Use follow-up questions to clarify before making a final decision.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, current, and organization-specific evidence that mobile updates are from trusted sources, unsupported IoT devices are removed, and cloud update responsibilities are understood and managed. Responses must be practical but credible, with documentation or screenshots where possible. Incomplete, generic, or unsupported claims should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.
