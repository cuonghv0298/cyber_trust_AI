            ## Evaluation Prompt

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4e  
**Clause: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision Requirement:** Accounts with access rights that are no longer required or have exceeded the requested date shall have their access disabled or removed from the system. Shared, duplicate, obsolete and invalid accounts shall be removed.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must have a process to promptly disable or remove user accounts (including employees, contractors, vendors, etc.) when access is no longer required—such as at the end of employment, contract, or project. Additionally, shared, duplicate, obsolete, or invalid accounts must be identified and removed to prevent unauthorized access.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
- Reduce risk of data breaches from dormant or forgotten accounts.
- Ensure only current, authorized users have access.

**Context/Importance:**  
Dormant or unnecessary accounts are a common attack vector for cybercriminals. Removing or disabling such accounts is a fundamental security hygiene practice, especially for organizations with limited resources, as it significantly reduces risk with minimal effort.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- There is a documented and consistently applied process for removing or disabling user accounts when access is no longer required (e.g., upon employee exit, contract end, or role change).
- The process covers all types of accounts (staff, contractors, vendors, etc.).
- There is evidence that shared, duplicate, obsolete, and invalid accounts are regularly identified and removed.
- The process is implemented in practice, not just documented.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process exists, or the process is not documented or communicated.
- The process is ad hoc, informal, or inconsistently applied.
- Accounts remain active after users have left or no longer require access.
- Shared, duplicate, or obsolete accounts are present and unmanaged.
- No evidence of account reviews or removals.

### Partial Compliance
- A process exists but is not consistently followed or lacks coverage for all account types.
- Some evidence of account removal, but with gaps (e.g., only for full-time staff, not contractors).
- Process is manual and prone to oversight, with no periodic review.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedures or checklists for offboarding and account removal.
- Screenshots or logs showing recent account removals/disablements.
- User account lists before and after offboarding events.
- Records of periodic account reviews or audits.
- Communication records (e.g., HR-IT handover emails).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Procedures should be clear, actionable, and tailored to the organization.
- Evidence should demonstrate actual implementation, not just intent.

### Red Flags
- Outdated or generic procedures not reflecting current practice.
- Evidence limited to policy documents with no proof of execution.
- Account lists showing active users who have left the organization.
- Lack of periodic review or audit records.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**"Is there a process to remove access to data for employees who have reached the end of contract?"**

#### What to Look For
- Description of a clear, repeatable process for removing access.
- Reference to both IT and HR involvement (e.g., HR notifies IT upon employee exit).
- Evidence of recent account removals.
- Mention of periodic account reviews for shared, duplicate, or obsolete accounts.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "Yes, when an employee leaves, HR notifies IT, and IT disables all accounts within 24 hours. We keep a checklist and review accounts monthly to remove any obsolete or duplicate accounts. See attached offboarding checklist and recent account removal logs."
- "We have a documented offboarding process. All user accounts are reviewed and removed upon contract end. Attached are screenshots of our user management system showing recent removals."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We usually remember to remove accounts when someone leaves."
- "We don't have many employees, so we just delete accounts when we notice."
- "No formal process, but IT handles it."
- "We have a policy, but no evidence of recent removals."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide a sample of a recent offboarding event and the corresponding account removal?"
- "How do you ensure that shared or duplicate accounts are identified and removed?"
- "How often do you review user accounts for validity?"
- "Does your process cover contractors and temporary staff?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple checklist or manual process is acceptable, provided it is consistently applied and documented.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized procedures and periodic reviews.

### Resource Constraints
- Automated tools are not required; manual processes are acceptable if effective.
- Evidence can be simple (e.g., annotated screenshots, basic checklists).

### Industry Context
- Organizations with high staff turnover or many contractors should have more frequent reviews.
- Sectors with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter controls.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Relying solely on memory or informal practices.
- Overlooking non-employee accounts (contractors, vendors).
- Failing to address shared or generic accounts.

### Documentation Issues
- Policies without proof of implementation.
- Outdated or incomplete procedures.
- Lack of evidence for recent account removals.

### False Positives
- Descriptions of intent without supporting evidence.
- Evidence of a process for employees, but not for other account types.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented process for account removal?**
   - If YES, proceed to 2.
   - If NO, FAIL.

2. **Is the process consistently applied to all relevant account types?**
   - If YES, proceed to 3.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL depending on scope.

3. **Is there recent evidence of account removals and periodic reviews?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL.

4. **Are shared, duplicate, obsolete, and invalid accounts addressed?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation.
- If significant gaps or inconsistencies are found, escalate to a senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate a clear, consistently applied process for removing or disabling accounts when access is no longer required, with supporting evidence of recent implementation and coverage of all account types. Inadequate, informal, or undocumented processes, or lack of evidence, should result in a FAIL. Use practical judgment for small organizations, but require at least basic documentation and evidence of execution.
