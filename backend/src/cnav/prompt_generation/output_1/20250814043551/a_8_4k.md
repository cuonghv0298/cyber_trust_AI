            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4k  
**Clause:** Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline  
**Provision:** As good practice, backups should be tested at least bi-annually, or more frequently, to ensure that business-critical systems and essential business information can be restored effectively.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must test their backup restoration process at least twice a year (bi-annually) to confirm that essential data and business-critical systems can be restored successfully. This means not only creating backups but also verifying, through actual restoration tests, that these backups are usable and effective.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure that backup data is reliable and can be restored in the event of data loss, ransomware, or system failure.
- Minimize business disruption by confirming that restoration processes work as intended.
- Identify and address any issues with backup integrity or restoration procedures before an actual incident occurs.

**Context & Importance:**  
Testing backups is critical because untested backups may be incomplete, corrupted, or unusable when needed. Regular testing is a baseline control to ensure business continuity and resilience against common cyber threats.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization conducts backup restoration tests at least every six months (bi-annually) or more frequently.
- Tests include actual restoration of data (not just verification that backups exist).
- Evidence demonstrates that tests cover business-critical systems and essential data.
- There is documentation or records of the most recent backup tests, including dates and outcomes.
- Any issues found during tests are documented and addressed.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of backup restoration tests being conducted in the past 12 months.
- Tests are only theoretical or involve checking backup files exist, without actual restoration.
- Restoration tests are ad hoc, irregular, or not scheduled.
- No documentation or records of backup tests.
- Tests do not cover business-critical systems or essential data.

### Partial Compliance
- Restoration tests are conducted, but less frequently than bi-annually (e.g., only once a year).
- Tests are performed, but documentation is incomplete or missing key details (e.g., no outcomes recorded).
- Only some critical systems/data are tested, not all.
- Organization claims to test but cannot provide sufficient evidence.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Backup test logs or reports showing dates, systems/data tested, and results.
- Screenshots or records from backup software indicating restoration tests.
- Meeting minutes, emails, or calendar invites confirming test activities.
- Incident or issue logs showing follow-up actions from failed tests.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be dated and clearly show that tests occurred within the last 6 months (or at least twice in the last 12 months).
- Should specify what data/systems were restored and the outcome (success/failure).
- Evidence should be attributable to the organization (not generic vendor documentation).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated, generic, or not specific to the organization.
- Only backup schedules or backup existence is shown, with no restoration test proof.
- Evidence is outdated (older than 6 months).
- Fabricated or template documents with no real details.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question: **Are backups tested at least bi-annually to ensure effective restoration?**

#### What to Look For
- Clear statement that restoration tests are performed at least every 6 months.
- Description of the restoration process and what is tested.
- Dates and outcomes of the last two tests.
- Evidence supporting the claim (see above).

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We conduct restoration tests every March and September. Our last test was on 15 March 2024, where we restored our finance and HR databases successfully. Attached are the test logs and screenshots from our backup software."
- "Backup restoration is tested twice a year as per our IT schedule. The most recent test was on 1 June 2024, covering all business-critical systems. See attached report."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We back up our data regularly." (No mention of restoration testing.)
- "We check that backups exist every month." (No restoration.)
- "We did a test last year." (Only one test in 12 months.)
- "No evidence provided."

#### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide logs or reports from your most recent restoration test?
- Which systems and data are included in your restoration tests?
- What issues, if any, were identified during your last test, and how were they addressed?
- Who is responsible for conducting and documenting these tests?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, restoration tests may be manual and less formal, but there must still be evidence (e.g., screenshots, simple logs, or emails confirming the test).
- The scope of testing should be proportionate to the size and complexity of the organization but must include all essential data and systems.

### Resource Constraints
- Accept simple, low-cost evidence (e.g., annotated screenshots, basic logs) if formal reports are not feasible.
- Restoration tests can be performed by non-specialist staff if documented.

### Industry Context
- For organizations with highly sensitive or regulated data, more rigorous testing may be expected.
- For sectors with minimal IT infrastructure, ensure at least the most critical data (e.g., customer records, financial data) is included in tests.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Confusing backup creation with restoration testing.
- Only testing a subset of data, ignoring critical systems.
- Infrequent or ad hoc testing.

### Documentation Issues
- Missing or outdated test records.
- Evidence that does not specify what was restored or the test outcome.

### False Positives
- Responses that describe backup schedules but not restoration.
- Evidence that is generic or not organization-specific.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Has the organization provided evidence of at least two restoration tests in the past 12 months?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to next check.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Do the tests cover business-critical systems and essential data?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to next check.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.

3. **Is the evidence credible, dated, and organization-specific?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.

4. **Were any issues found during tests addressed?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (if issues not addressed).

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If only partial compliance is demonstrated, seek clarification or additional documentation.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for frequency, scope, and evidence quality across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, dated evidence of at least bi-annual restoration tests covering all essential data and systems. Accept proportionate, practical evidence for smaller organizations, but do not accept mere backup existence or schedules without restoration testing. Incomplete, outdated, or generic evidence should result in a FAIL or request for further information. Use the decision tree to ensure consistent, fair, and thorough assessments.
