# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.3.4e  
**Clause: Assets: Data – Know what data the organisation has, where they are, and secure the data**  
**Provision: Before disposing of any paper-based (hard copy) media, the organisation shall carry out steps to ensure that those containing confidential and/or sensitive data have been securely shredded.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that any paper-based media (e.g., printed documents, forms, reports) containing confidential or sensitive data are securely destroyed—specifically, by shredding—before disposal. This applies to all hard copy records that could expose sensitive information if discarded improperly.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive/confidential information after disposal.
- Reduce risk of data breaches via physical document recovery from bins or recycling.
- Demonstrate awareness and control over the lifecycle of sensitive data.

**Context & Importance:**  
Physical documents are a common source of data leakage, especially in resource-constrained environments. Secure shredding is a simple, effective, and affordable control to prevent data compromise from discarded paper records.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a documented or clearly described procedure for securely disposing of hard copy media containing sensitive/confidential data.
- The procedure explicitly requires shredding (using a shredder or secure shredding service) before disposal.
- There is evidence that shredders are available and used, or that a reputable shredding service is engaged.
- Staff are aware of and follow the procedure.

### FAIL Criteria
- No procedure exists, or the procedure does not address secure shredding of sensitive/confidential documents.
- The organization disposes of sensitive/confidential paper records in regular bins or recycling without shredding.
- No shredder is available, and no secure shredding service is used.
- Responses are vague, generic, or indicate ad-hoc/uncontrolled disposal.

### Partial Compliance
- Procedure exists but is informal (e.g., verbal instructions only), or only some sensitive documents are shredded.
- Shredder is available but not consistently used, or only certain staff are aware of the requirement.
- The organization outsources shredding but cannot provide details or evidence of the service.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedure or policy (even if brief or informal) describing shredding of sensitive/confidential documents.
- Photographs of shredders in use, purchase receipts, or maintenance logs.
- Service agreements or invoices from secure shredding providers.
- Staff communications or training materials referencing shredding requirements.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be current (within the last 12 months).
- Procedures should be specific to sensitive/confidential data, not just general waste.
- If using a service, provider should be reputable and service should be periodic.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to sensitive/confidential data.
- No proof of shredder/service, or only verbal assurances.
- Documents referencing shredding but no supporting artifacts.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**"Do you have a procedure to dispose of hard copy media? Any paper shredders?"**

#### What to Look For
- Clear description of a process for identifying and shredding sensitive/confidential documents.
- Existence and use of a shredder or secure shredding service.
- Evidence that staff are aware of and follow the process.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We have a shredder in the office. All documents containing customer or business-sensitive information are shredded before disposal. Staff are instructed to use the shredder for such documents."
- "We use [Company Name] secure shredding service monthly for all confidential paperwork. Service agreement attached."
- "Our office policy (attached) requires all sensitive documents to be shredded. Shredder purchase receipt attached."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We throw away old papers in the bin."
- "We recycle all documents, including sensitive ones."
- "We don’t have a shredder, but we tear up papers by hand."
- "No formal process, staff use their own judgment."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide a copy of the written procedure or staff instructions?"
- "Can you show evidence of the shredder or shredding service?"
- "How do you ensure all staff follow the shredding requirement?"
- "How do you identify which documents are considered sensitive/confidential?"

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple, clearly communicated process and a basic shredder are sufficient.
- Written procedures can be brief (e.g., a one-page memo or email).

### Resource Constraints
- A low-cost shredder is acceptable; industrial shredders or expensive services are not required.
- Outsourcing to a secure shredding provider is acceptable if cost-effective.

### Industry Context
- Organizations in sectors handling large volumes of sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more robust controls.
- For organizations with minimal paper records, a simple process and occasional shredding may suffice.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming general waste disposal is sufficient.
- Only shredding some documents, not all sensitive/confidential ones.
- No process for staff to identify sensitive documents.

### Documentation Issues
- No written evidence of procedure or staff instructions.
- Outdated or irrelevant evidence (e.g., old purchase receipts with no current shredder).

### False Positives
- Stating a shredder exists but providing no evidence of use or staff awareness.
- Claiming to use a shredding service but unable to provide service records.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a procedure (written or clearly described) for shredding sensitive/confidential paper documents before disposal?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Next

2. **Is there evidence of a shredder or secure shredding service in use?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Next

3. **Is the procedure communicated to and followed by staff?**
   - **No/Unclear** → Partial Compliance (request clarification)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence, escalate to senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scale (e.g., micro-businesses may have simpler documentation).
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, practical process for shredding sensitive/confidential paper documents, evidence of a shredder or secure shredding service, and indications that staff are aware of and follow the process. Responses lacking these elements should be marked as FAIL, with partial compliance flagged for further investigation. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement: sensitive/confidential paper records must be securely shredded before disposal.
