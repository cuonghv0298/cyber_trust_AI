# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4f  
**Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Logging should also be enabled for software and hardware assets where feasible, e.g., system, events and security logs.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must enable logging on their software and hardware assets wherever it is feasible. This includes, at a minimum, system logs, event logs, and security logs on devices such as servers, workstations, network equipment (e.g., firewalls, routers), and critical applications.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure that security-relevant events are recorded for later review and investigation.
- Support detection of suspicious or unauthorized activities.
- Provide evidence in the event of a security incident.

**Context & Importance:**  
Logging is a foundational security control that enables organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. Without logs, it is difficult to determine what happened during a security event or to demonstrate compliance. For resource-constrained organizations, enabling basic logging on key assets is a practical and effective step toward baseline security.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Logging is enabled on all feasible software and hardware assets, including (at minimum) servers, workstations, and network devices.
- The organization can identify which assets have logging enabled and which do not, with justification for any exclusions (e.g., technical limitations).
- The types of logs enabled (system, event, security) are specified.
- Evidence (e.g., screenshots, configuration exports) demonstrates that logging is active.

### FAIL Criteria
- Logging is not enabled on any or most assets, with no justification.
- The organization is unaware of logging settings or cannot specify which assets have logging enabled.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.
- Exclusions are made without reasonable justification.

### Partial Compliance
- Logging is enabled on some, but not all, feasible assets.
- The organization provides partial evidence or incomplete asset coverage.
- Some justifications for exclusions are reasonable, but others are missing or unclear.
- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine compliance.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of logging settings from representative devices (e.g., Windows Event Viewer, Linux syslog, firewall log configuration).
- Configuration exports or reports showing logging is enabled.
- Asset inventory indicating which devices have logging enabled.
- Policy or procedure documents referencing logging requirements (optional but supportive).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 6 months).
- Screenshots or exports must clearly show the asset name and logging status.
- Evidence should cover a representative sample of asset types (not just one device).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not tied to the organization’s actual assets.
- Screenshots are cropped to hide identifying information.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence is identical across unrelated assets (suggesting fabrication).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear statement that logging is enabled on all (or all feasible) assets.
- List or description of asset types covered (e.g., “All Windows PCs and our firewall have logging enabled”).
- Justification for any assets where logging is not enabled (e.g., “Our printer does not support logging”).
- Supporting evidence as described above.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Logging is enabled on all our servers, workstations, and firewall. See attached screenshots from Windows Event Viewer and our firewall’s log settings.”
- “We have enabled system and security logs on all computers. Our network switch does not support logging, which we have confirmed with the vendor.”
- “Attached is our asset inventory with a column indicating logging status, plus screenshots from representative devices.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We don’t know if logging is enabled.”
- “We don’t have time to check logging settings.”
- “Logging is only enabled on one device, but we have 10 computers.”
- No evidence provided, or evidence is not related to logging.

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide screenshots or configuration exports from additional devices?”
- “Why is logging not enabled on these specific assets?”
- “When was logging last reviewed or verified?”
- “How do you ensure logging remains enabled after updates or changes?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), evidence from each device may be practical and expected.
- For larger organizations, a representative sample (e.g., 2-3 devices per asset type) is acceptable.

### Resource Constraints
- If certain devices cannot support logging due to technical limitations, a reasonable explanation is acceptable.
- Manual processes for checking logging are acceptable if automated tools are not available.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have additional regulatory requirements for logging; however, for Cyber Essentials, only baseline logging is required.
- For organizations using cloud services, ensure logging is enabled in cloud management consoles where feasible.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Logging only enabled on servers, ignoring workstations or network devices.
- No justification for assets without logging.
- Outdated or irrelevant evidence.

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots without timestamps or asset identifiers.
- Evidence from test or non-production systems.

### False Positives
- Policy documents stating logging is required, but no evidence of actual implementation.
- Evidence from a single device presented as representative of all assets.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is logging enabled on all feasible assets?**
   - **Yes:** Go to 2.
   - **No:** Go to 3.

2. **Is sufficient, recent, and credible evidence provided for a representative sample of assets?**
   - **Yes:** **PASS**
   - **No:** **Partial Compliance** (request more evidence)

3. **Are exclusions justified and reasonable?**
   - **Yes:** Go to 2.
   - **No:** **FAIL**

4. **Is there a clear lack of awareness or evidence regarding logging?**
   - **Yes:** **FAIL**

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If the organization claims technical limitations, request vendor documentation or further explanation.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same evidence and justification standards across all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that logging is enabled on all feasible assets, with reasonable justifications for any exclusions. Responses must be practical and proportionate to the organization’s size and resources, but must demonstrate actual implementation, not just intent or policy. Incomplete, outdated, or generic evidence should result in follow-up or a FAIL decision.
