# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4o  
**Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision Requirement:** Where feasible, two-factor authentication (2FA) should be used for administrative access to important systems, such as an Internet-facing system containing sensitive or business-critical data. Organisations may implement this in different ways, e.g., use of an authenticator application on the mobile or one-time password (OTP) token.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must implement two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for administrative access to important systems—especially those that are Internet-facing and/or contain sensitive or business-critical data. This means that, in addition to a password, a second authentication factor (such as an OTP, authenticator app, or hardware token) is required for admin logins.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized administrative access, even if passwords are compromised.
- Reduce risk of breaches on critical systems.
- Protect sensitive and business-critical data from common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, credential stuffing).

**Context/Importance:**  
Administrative accounts are high-value targets. 2FA is a proven, practical control that significantly raises the bar for attackers, especially for organizations with limited resources. This is a baseline expectation for Internet-facing and sensitive systems.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- 2FA/MFA is enabled for all administrative accounts on all important systems (especially Internet-facing or those with sensitive/business-critical data).
- The organization can clearly identify which systems are covered and describe the 2FA method(s) used (e.g., authenticator app, OTP, hardware token).
- Evidence (screenshots, policy, configuration) supports the claim that 2FA is in place and enforced for admin access.

### FAIL Criteria
- 2FA/MFA is not implemented for administrative access to important systems.
- The organization cannot identify which systems require 2FA, or claims it is “not feasible” without justification.
- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or shows 2FA is not enforced for admin accounts.

### Partial Compliance
- 2FA is implemented on some, but not all, important systems or admin accounts.
- 2FA is only enabled for user (not admin) accounts.
- The organization claims technical or business constraints prevent full implementation, but does not provide a reasonable risk-based justification or compensating controls.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of admin login prompts showing 2FA/MFA requirement.
- Configuration settings from admin portals (e.g., cloud console, server admin panel) showing 2FA enabled.
- Policy documents or procedures mandating 2FA for admin access.
- List of important systems with 2FA status.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 3 months).
- Screenshots must clearly show the system, user role (admin), and 2FA prompt.
- Policies must be specific (not generic statements).
- Evidence must match the systems described in the self-assessment.

### Red Flags
- Screenshots cropped to hide system details or user roles.
- Policies that mention 2FA but do not specify admin access or systems covered.
- Evidence only for user (not admin) accounts.
- Outdated evidence or evidence from test environments.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear identification of which systems are considered “important” (Internet-facing, sensitive, business-critical).
- Description of 2FA/MFA methods used for admin access.
- Evidence that 2FA is enforced for all admin accounts on these systems.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We use Google Workspace admin console; all admin accounts require 2FA via Google Authenticator. See attached screenshot of admin login prompt.”
- “Our cloud server admin panel (AWS/Azure) enforces MFA for all admin users. Attached: screenshot of MFA settings and login prompt.”
- “We have a policy requiring 2FA for admin access to our CRM and finance systems. Attached: policy excerpt and screenshot of login page.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We use strong passwords for admin accounts, but no 2FA.”
- “2FA is enabled for user accounts, not admins.”
- “We plan to implement 2FA in the future.”
- “Not feasible due to technical limitations” (without justification or compensating controls).

### Follow-up Questions
- Which systems are considered important and why?
- Are all admin accounts covered by 2FA? If not, why?
- What 2FA methods are used (app, SMS, hardware token)?
- How is 2FA enforced (mandatory, optional, self-enrollment)?
- Can you provide a screenshot of an admin login with 2FA prompt?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), it is acceptable if only a few admin accounts exist, but all must have 2FA.
- If only one admin exists, 2FA must still be enabled for that account.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or built-in 2FA solutions (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) are acceptable.
- SMS-based 2FA is acceptable if more secure options are not feasible.

### Industry Context
- For organizations in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare), higher assurance 2FA may be expected.
- For organizations with no Internet-facing systems, auditor should confirm this claim and ensure internal critical systems are still considered.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- 2FA only enabled for some admin accounts.
- 2FA enabled for users, not admins.
- 2FA not enforced (optional enrollment).
- No clear identification of important systems.

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots not showing admin login.
- Policies too generic or not enforced.
- Evidence from non-production systems.

### False Positives
- Claims of 2FA with no supporting evidence.
- Evidence of 2FA for unrelated systems.
- 2FA enabled but not enforced for all admins.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are all admin accounts on important systems protected by 2FA?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is there credible, current evidence showing 2FA is enforced for admin access?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** FAIL.

3. **Is the evidence specific to admin accounts and important systems?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial (seek clarification).

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims 2FA is not feasible, escalate to senior auditor for risk-based review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and risk profile.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Ensure that evidence is directly relevant to the systems and accounts in scope.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, current evidence that 2FA is enforced for all admin accounts on important systems, especially those that are Internet-facing or contain sensitive/business-critical data. Acceptable methods include authenticator apps, OTP tokens, or SMS. Responses lacking evidence, specificity, or coverage should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not waive the requirement for admin 2FA.
