# Evaluation Prompt for A.8.4f
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.8.4f

            ## Provision ID
            A.8.4f

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations that use mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) and/or IoT devices (e.g., sensors, smart cameras) within the certification scope must ensure that essential business data stored on these devices is regularly backed up. For mobile devices, this means enabling automatic backup and transferring data to a secondary device or secure storage (e.g., cloud, secondary phone). For IoT devices, where automatic backup may not be available, essential data must be backed up manually.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent loss of essential business data due to device loss, theft, failure, or compromise.
- Ensure business continuity by enabling data restoration from backup.
- Reduce the impact of ransomware or other destructive attacks on mobile/IoT assets.

**Context & Importance:**  
Mobile and IoT devices are often overlooked in backup strategies but can contain critical business information. Their loss or compromise can disrupt operations or result in data breaches. This provision ensures organizations have a basic, practical backup process for these devices, tailored to their technical limitations.

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization identifies all mobile and IoT devices in scope.
- Essential business data on these devices is regularly backed up.
    - For mobile devices: Automatic backup is enabled (e.g., to cloud or secondary device), or regular manual backup is performed.
    - For IoT devices: Manual backup procedures are in place and performed at reasonable intervals.
- Backups are stored in a separate location/device (not just on the original device).
- The backup process is documented and evidence of recent backups is available.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No backup process exists for mobile or IoT devices containing essential data.
- Backups are only stored on the original device (no redundancy).
- The organization cannot demonstrate that backups have occurred.
- The organization claims no essential data is stored on these devices, but evidence suggests otherwise.

### **Partial Compliance**
- Backups are performed, but not regularly or only for some devices.
- Backup process is ad hoc or undocumented.
- Only some types of essential data are backed up.
- Evidence is incomplete or outdated.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Screenshots showing backup settings enabled on mobile devices (e.g., cloud backup, scheduled backups).
- Logs or records of recent backup activities.
- Written procedures or policies describing backup frequency and methods for mobile/IoT devices.
- Photos or documentation of manual backup processes for IoT devices.
- Inventory of devices and data types backed up.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).
- Screenshots/logs must clearly show device identifiers and backup status.
- Written procedures should be clear, concise, and reflect actual practice.
- Evidence should match the devices and data types described in the self-assessment.

### **Red Flags**
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not device-specific.
- Screenshots or logs are incomplete or do not show backup success.
- No evidence of backup for IoT devices where essential data is present.
- Claims of “no essential data” without supporting justification.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Clear identification of mobile and IoT devices in use.
- Description of what constitutes “essential data” on these devices.
- Explanation of backup methods (automatic/manual, frequency, storage location).
- Evidence that backup is performed and recent.

### **Acceptable Responses**
- “All company mobile phones have automatic cloud backup enabled for contacts, SMS, and business app data. Screenshots attached.”
- “IoT sensors in our warehouse store operational logs. These are manually downloaded to a secure server weekly. Backup logs attached.”
- “We use WhatsApp for client communications on mobile devices; chat backups are scheduled daily to Google Drive.”

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “We don’t back up mobile phones, but we haven’t lost any data yet.”
- “IoT devices are not backed up because it’s too difficult.”
- “We don’t think there’s any essential data on our devices” (without justification or inventory).
- “Backups are done sometimes, but we don’t keep records.”

### **Follow-up Questions**
- Can you provide a screenshot or log of the most recent backup for a representative device?
- How do you determine which data is essential on your mobile/IoT devices?
- Where are backups stored, and how do you ensure they are not on the same device?
- How often are manual backups performed for IoT devices?

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), a simple manual backup process (e.g., weekly download to a USB drive or cloud storage) is acceptable if documented and performed regularly.
- For organizations with only a few devices, evidence for each device should be provided.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Use of built-in cloud backup features (e.g., Google/iCloud) is acceptable and encouraged.
- Manual backup for IoT devices is sufficient if automation is not feasible.

### **Industry Context**
- In sectors with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare), backup frequency and security should be proportionate to data criticality.
- For organizations with only consumer-grade IoT devices, a simple manual process is acceptable.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Overlooking essential data stored in messaging apps or contacts.
- Assuming cloud sync (e.g., email) is a backup without verifying coverage of all essential data.
- Not backing up IoT device data at all.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Lack of evidence for manual backups.
- Outdated screenshots or logs.
- No written backup procedure.

### **False Positives**
- Claiming “automatic backup enabled” without evidence.
- Providing evidence for only some devices or data types.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Are mobile/IoT devices in scope and do they store essential data?**
    - If NO: Confirm with inventory and justification. PASS if justified.
    - If YES: Proceed.
2. **Is there a documented backup process for these devices?**
    - If NO: FAIL.
    - If YES: Proceed.
3. **Is there recent evidence of backup (screenshots, logs, records)?**
    - If NO: FAIL.
    - If YES: Proceed.
4. **Are backups stored separately from the original device?**
    - If NO: FAIL.
    - If YES: PASS.

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request clarification or additional evidence.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims “no essential data” but this is questionable.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across all organizations of similar size and device usage.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and device-specific evidence that essential data on mobile and IoT devices is regularly backed up and stored separately. Accept reasonable, practical approaches for small organizations, but do not accept undocumented, ad hoc, or unsubstantiated claims. Use the decision tree and follow-up questions to ensure consistent, fair, and thorough evaluation.
