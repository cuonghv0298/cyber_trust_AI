# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4c  
**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software â€“ Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  
**Provision: The inventory list should contain details of the hardware assets where available as follows: name/model, serial number, type, location, network address, owner, classification, department, approval/authorised date, and end-of-support date.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must maintain a hardware asset inventory that, where possible, includes the following details for each device:
- Hardware name/model
- Asset tag or serial number
- Asset type (e.g., laptop, server, printer)
- Asset location (physical or logical)
- Network address (e.g., IP, MAC)
- Asset owner (person or role)
- Asset classification (e.g., confidential, public)
- Department
- Approval/authorised date (when asset was approved/added)
- End of Support (EOS) date

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all hardware assets are accounted for and traceable.
- Enable rapid response to incidents involving specific devices.
- Support lifecycle management (e.g., timely replacement of unsupported devices).
- Reduce risk of unmanaged or rogue devices.

**Context/Importance:**  
A comprehensive hardware inventory is foundational for basic cybersecurity. It enables organizations to identify, secure, and manage all devices that could be targeted or exploited. Missing or incomplete inventories are a common root cause of security incidents.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides an inventory list (spreadsheet, database, or similar) that includes **all required fields** for each hardware asset, **where information is available**.
- For fields not applicable (e.g., network address for a standalone printer), the inventory clearly marks them as "N/A" or similar, with justification.
- The inventory is **current** (updated within the last 12 months or since significant changes).
- The inventory covers **all relevant hardware assets** (not just servers or laptops, but also network devices, printers, etc.).

### FAIL Criteria
- The inventory is missing **multiple required fields** for most or all assets, with no justification.
- The inventory is **outdated** (not updated in over 12 months or clearly missing recent assets).
- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only lists some asset types, or omits key devices).
- The organization cannot provide an inventory or only provides a generic statement without evidence.

### Partial Compliance
- The inventory is mostly complete but missing **one or two fields** for most assets (e.g., EOS date not tracked, but all other fields present).
- Some fields are marked "unknown" or "N/A" without clear justification.
- The inventory is current but only covers a subset of assets (e.g., only IT-managed devices, not user-owned devices connected to the network).

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Hardware asset inventory file (spreadsheet, asset management tool export, etc.).
- Screenshots of asset management systems showing required fields.
- Sample records demonstrating field completion.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be **organization-specific** (not a template or blank form).
- Inventory should show **real data** for actual assets.
- Fields should be filled in for each asset, or marked "N/A" with explanation.
- Evidence should be **recent** (dated within the last 12 months).

### Red Flags
- Inventory is a template with no real data.
- Inventory only lists asset names or types, with no other details.
- Evidence is undated or clearly outdated.
- Obvious copy-paste or fabricated entries (e.g., all assets have the same serial number).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Does the inventory include **all required fields** for each asset?
- Are fields completed with **specific, plausible values**?
- Are all relevant hardware types included?
- Is the inventory **current** and **organization-specific**?

### Acceptable Responses
- "Yes, our inventory includes all required fields. See attached spreadsheet showing name/model, serial number, type, location, network address, owner, classification, department, approval date, and EOS date for each device."
- Inventory file with columns for each required field, filled in for each asset.
- "For some assets (e.g., legacy printers), EOS date is marked 'N/A' as not available."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We have an inventory, but it only lists device names and types."
- "We do not track EOS dates or asset owners."
- "Our inventory is in progress and not yet complete."
- "We do not have an inventory, but plan to create one."

### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide a sample of your inventory showing all required fields?"
- "How often is the inventory updated?"
- "How do you handle assets where some information is not available?"
- "Does your inventory include all device types (e.g., printers, network devices, mobile devices)?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), a simple spreadsheet is acceptable.
- For micro-businesses, some fields (e.g., department) may be "N/A" if not applicable.

### Resource Constraints
- Reasonable effort means tracking all fields **where possible**; some legacy or simple devices may lack certain data (e.g., EOS date).
- Use of free or basic tools (Excel, Google Sheets) is acceptable.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., retail, healthcare) may have specialized devices; ensure these are included.
- For organizations with remote or hybrid work, ensure home office devices are considered if used for business.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Missing EOS dates or approval dates.
- Inventory only covers servers and laptops, omitting other devices.
- Fields left blank without explanation.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is a template, not actual data.
- Inventory is not dated or shows no recent updates.

### False Positives
- Inventory appears complete but is not organization-specific.
- All fields are filled with identical or generic values.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is an inventory provided with all required fields for each asset?**
   - **Yes:** Go to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Are all fields completed or marked "N/A" with justification?**
   - **Yes:** Go to 3.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.

3. **Is the inventory current and covers all relevant assets?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If inventory is mostly complete but missing a few fields, request clarification or additional evidence.
- If evidence appears fabricated or incomplete, escalate to senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for completeness and currency across all organizations.
- Allow reasonable flexibility for very small organizations, but all required fields must be addressed where possible.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must provide a current, organization-specific hardware inventory that includes all required fields for each asset, with reasonable explanations for any "N/A" entries. Incomplete, outdated, or generic inventories should result in FAIL or Partial Compliance, with clear documentation of gaps and follow-up actions.
