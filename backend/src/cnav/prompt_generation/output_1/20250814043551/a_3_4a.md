# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.3.4a  
**Clause: Assets: Data – Know what data the organisation has, where they are, and secure the data**  
**Provision Requirement:** The organisation shall identify and maintain an inventory of business-critical data, including description, classification/sensitivity, location, and retention period.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must maintain a current inventory of all business-critical data. This inventory must include, at minimum:
- A description of each data set or type
- Its classification or sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential)
- Where the data is stored (location: physical or digital)
- The retention period for each data set

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Ensure the organization knows what critical data it holds and where it resides
- Enable appropriate protection and compliance with legal/regulatory requirements
- Support effective data management, risk assessment, and incident response

**Context/Importance:**  
Without a clear understanding of what data exists, where it is, and its sensitivity, organizations cannot adequately protect their information assets. This is foundational for all other security controls and for compliance with regulations such as PDPA.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides a data inventory (e.g., spreadsheet, table, or asset management tool output) listing all business-critical data.
- For each data entry, the following are clearly documented:
    - Description of the data (e.g., "Customer contact details", "Payroll records")
    - Data classification/sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential)
    - Location (e.g., "HR shared drive", "Cloud storage: Google Drive", "Physical file cabinet in HQ")
    - Retention period (e.g., "7 years", "Until contract termination", "Indefinite")
- The inventory is up-to-date (reviewed/updated within the last 12 months).
- The inventory covers all critical business functions and data types relevant to the organization’s operations.

### FAIL Criteria
- No data inventory is provided, or the inventory is missing entirely.
- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only lists some data, or omits key fields such as classification or retention).
- The inventory is outdated (not reviewed/updated in the last 12 months).
- Responses are vague, generic, or do not demonstrate knowledge of what data is held or where it is stored.
- No evidence is provided to support claims.

### Partial Compliance
- The inventory is present but missing one or more required fields (e.g., retention period not specified).
- The inventory covers only some business-critical data, or only some departments/functions.
- Evidence is provided but is not fully up-to-date or lacks clarity.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Data inventory document (spreadsheet, table, or export from asset management tool)
- Screenshots of inventory if tool-based
- Policy or procedure documents referencing data inventory maintenance
- Evidence of recent review/update (e.g., date last updated, version history)

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be specific to the organization (not a generic template)
- All required fields (description, classification, location, retention) must be present for each data entry
- Inventory should be readable, logically organized, and cover all critical data
- Evidence should be dated within the last 12 months

### Red Flags
- Inventory is a blank template or contains placeholder text
- Inventory is missing key fields or is incomplete
- Evidence is undated or clearly outdated
- Inventory lists only IT assets (e.g., servers, laptops) but not data types
- Contradictions between inventory and self-assessment responses

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear identification of business-critical data types (not just generic categories)
- Explicit data classification (e.g., "Confidential", "Internal", "Public")
- Specific storage locations (not just "on the server" or "in the cloud")
- Defined retention periods for each data type
- Evidence that the inventory is maintained and reviewed

### Acceptable Responses & Evidence
- "We maintain a spreadsheet listing all customer, employee, and financial data. Each entry includes a description, classification (Confidential/Internal), storage location (e.g., Google Drive, HR folder), and retention period (e.g., 7 years for payroll). Last updated: March 2024. [Spreadsheet attached]"
- "Our asset management tool tracks all business data sets, with fields for sensitivity, location, and retention. Screenshot attached showing sample entries."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We know what data we have, but do not keep a formal inventory."
- "All our data is in the cloud."
- "We keep data as long as needed."
- "See attached template" (with no actual data filled in)
- "We follow PDPA" (without evidence of inventory)

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide a sample of your data inventory?
- When was the inventory last reviewed or updated?
- How do you determine data classification and retention periods?
- Are all business-critical data types included (e.g., HR, customer, financial)?
- How do you ensure the inventory stays current?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet or table is acceptable.
- Inventory may be brief but must still cover all critical data types and required fields.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual inventories are acceptable; sophisticated tools are not required.
- Reasonable effort means the inventory is maintained and reviewed at least annually.

### Industry Context
- Regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more detailed inventories.
- Consider sector-specific data types (e.g., patient records, financial statements).

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Inventory lists only IT assets, not data types
- Missing retention periods or data classification
- Inventory is not maintained or reviewed regularly

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is a template, not an actual inventory
- Inventory is outdated or incomplete
- No supporting evidence provided

### False Positives
- Responses that claim compliance but provide no evidence
- Inventories that list only a few data types, omitting others

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is a data inventory provided?**
    - No → FAIL
    - Yes → Proceed

2. **Does the inventory include all required fields (description, classification, location, retention)?**
    - No → Partial Compliance (request clarification/evidence)
    - Yes → Proceed

3. **Is the inventory up-to-date (reviewed/updated within 12 months)?**
    - No → Partial Compliance (request update)
    - Yes → Proceed

4. **Does the inventory cover all business-critical data?**
    - No → Partial Compliance (request clarification)
    - Yes → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims not to have any business-critical data, escalate for review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must provide a current, complete inventory of business-critical data, including description, classification, location, and retention period. Evidence must be specific, up-to-date, and cover all critical data types. Partial or missing information requires follow-up. No inventory or inadequate evidence results in FAIL. Adjust expectations for small organizations, but all must demonstrate basic data awareness and management.
