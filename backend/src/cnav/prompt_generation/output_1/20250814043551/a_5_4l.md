            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4l  
**Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision Requirement:**  
*The organisation shall change all default passwords and replace them with a strong passphrase, e.g., it should be at least twelve (12) characters long and include upper case, lower case, and/or special characters.*

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
- All default passwords on systems, devices, and applications must be changed.
- Replacement passwords must be strong passphrases:  
  - Minimum 12 characters  
  - Must include a mix of upper case, lower case, and/or special characters

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access due to weak or default credentials.
- Ensure passwords are sufficiently complex to resist brute-force and guessing attacks.

**Context & Importance:**  
Default passwords are widely known and easily exploited by attackers. Enforcing strong, unique passwords is a foundational security control, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Default passwords have been changed** on all systems, devices, and applications.
- **Password policy is enforced** (either technically or procedurally) requiring:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Use of upper and lower case letters, and/or special characters
- **Evidence supports** that the policy is in effect and applied to all relevant accounts.

### FAIL Criteria
- Default passwords remain in use on any system, device, or application.
- No password policy exists, or policy does not meet the minimum requirements.
- Passwords are shorter than 12 characters or lack required complexity.
- No evidence provided, or evidence contradicts the self-assessment.

### Partial Compliance
- Policy exists but is not fully enforced (e.g., only on some systems).
- Password length or complexity requirements are close but not fully met (e.g., 10 characters).
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of systems.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshot of password policy settings from IT systems (e.g., Windows Group Policy, cloud admin console).
- Excerpts from written password policy documents.
- Sample screenshots showing password creation/change screens enforcing requirements.
- Change logs or records showing default passwords were updated.
- Statements from IT staff confirming procedures.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Screenshots must clearly show relevant settings (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
- Written policies must be officially adopted and in use.
- Evidence should cover all relevant systems (not just a single device).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not organization-specific.
- Screenshots are cropped or do not show relevant settings.
- Policies are aspirational (“we plan to...”) rather than implemented.
- No mention of changing default passwords.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear statement that all default passwords have been changed.
- Description or screenshot of password policy enforcing:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Upper/lower case and/or special characters
- Evidence that policy is applied to all user and admin accounts.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We have changed all default passwords on our routers, servers, and applications. Our password policy requires at least 12 characters, including upper and lower case letters and special characters. See attached screenshot of our policy settings.”
- Screenshot from admin console showing password policy settings.
- Written policy excerpt with date of adoption and scope.

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We tell staff to use strong passwords, but do not enforce it.”
- “Most passwords are strong, but some systems still use defaults.”
- “Our passwords are at least 8 characters.”
- No evidence provided, or evidence does not mention default password changes.

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide evidence that default passwords have been changed on all devices?
- Is the password policy enforced technically, or just communicated to staff?
- Are there any exceptions to the policy? If so, why?
- When was the password policy last reviewed or updated?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), written policies may be informal, but technical enforcement (e.g., device settings) is still expected.
- Manual processes may be acceptable if documented and consistently applied.

### Resource Constraints
- Accept simple, clear evidence (e.g., screenshots, short policy statements) rather than extensive documentation.
- Allow for basic technical controls if advanced tools are not available.

### Industry Context
- For organizations with specialized devices (e.g., IoT, POS), ensure default credentials are changed even if device limitations exist.
- For cloud-based organizations, check password policies in cloud admin portals.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking non-IT devices (e.g., printers, routers) that retain default passwords.
- Policy exists but is not enforced in practice.
- Password length or complexity requirements are below standard.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is not organization-specific.
- Screenshots do not show relevant settings.
- Policy documents are undated or not in use.

### False Positives
- Statements of intent (“we plan to...”) without proof of implementation.
- Evidence from only one system when multiple are in use.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Has the organization changed all default passwords?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Is there a password policy requiring at least 12 characters and complexity?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Is the policy enforced (technically or procedurally) and evidence provided?**
   - If YES → PASS
   - If evidence is incomplete or unclear → Partial, request more info
   - If NO → FAIL

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or only partially covers systems, escalate to senior auditor or request additional evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that all default passwords have been changed and that a password policy enforcing at least 12 characters with complexity is in place and applied. Accept practical, proportionate evidence, but do not accept generic statements or policies that are not implemented. Escalate or request more information if responses are unclear or incomplete.
