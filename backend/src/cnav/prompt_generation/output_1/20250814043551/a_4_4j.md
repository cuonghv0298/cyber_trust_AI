            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**Provision Requirement:**  
The organisation shall ensure that its employees install/access only authorised software/attachments within the organisation from official or trusted sources.

**Practical Explanation:**  
This provision requires organizations to implement controls that prevent employees from installing or accessing unauthorized software or attachments, and to ensure that any software or documents accessed are from official or trusted sources (e.g., vendor websites, official app stores, or pre-approved internal repositories).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent introduction of malware or viruses via unauthorized or untrusted software/attachments.
- Reduce risk of data breaches, ransomware, or system compromise.
- Maintain a controlled and secure IT environment.

**Importance:**  
Uncontrolled installation or access to software and attachments is a leading cause of malware infections and security incidents, especially in organizations with limited IT oversight. This provision is a foundational defense against common cyber threats.

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization has clear, communicated policies or controls restricting software/attachment installation/access to authorized sources only.
- There are technical or procedural measures in place (e.g., user permissions, application whitelisting, restricted admin rights, email filtering, or documented approval processes).
- Employees are aware of these restrictions and know how to request new software or report suspicious attachments.
- Evidence supports that these measures are implemented and enforced.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No controls or policies exist to restrict software/attachment installation or access.
- Employees can freely install or access any software/attachments without oversight.
- No evidence of enforcement or communication of such restrictions.
- Reliance solely on “trusting employees” without supporting controls.

### **Partial Compliance**
- Some controls exist but are inconsistently applied (e.g., only on some devices or for some users).
- Policies exist but are not communicated or enforced.
- Technical controls are present but easily bypassed or not monitored.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the organization.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Written policies or guidelines on software/attachment installation/access.
- Screenshots or system settings showing restricted installation rights or application whitelisting.
- Email filtering or attachment scanning configurations.
- Training materials or communications to staff about these restrictions.
- Logs or records of software approval requests or incidents of blocked installations.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Policies/guidelines should be accessible and relevant to the organization’s environment.
- Technical evidence should clearly show restrictions in place (e.g., standard user accounts, blocked installation prompts).
- Training or communication evidence should demonstrate staff awareness.

### **Red Flags**
- Outdated or generic policies not tailored to the organization.
- Evidence only from a single device or user, not representative of the organization.
- Screenshots or documents with missing or redacted key information.
- No evidence of staff awareness or enforcement.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **Question:**  
**IT: What measures are in place to ensure that employees can only install / access authorised software / documents?**

#### **What to Look For**
- Description of both policy and technical/procedural controls.
- Mention of restricted user permissions, application whitelisting, or approval processes.
- Reference to email filtering or attachment scanning.
- Evidence that these measures are communicated and enforced.

#### **Acceptable Responses**
- “Employees have standard user accounts and cannot install software without IT approval. All software installations require a request to IT, who install only from official sources. Email attachments are scanned for malware, and staff are trained not to open suspicious files.”
- “We use application whitelisting to allow only approved software. Staff receive regular reminders about not installing unauthorized software or opening unknown attachments.”
- Supporting evidence: screenshots of user permissions, policy documents, training records, or email filtering settings.

#### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “We trust our employees to only install safe software.”
- “There is no restriction, but we tell staff to be careful.”
- “Anyone can install software if they want.”
- No supporting evidence or only verbal assurances.

#### **Follow-up Questions**
- How are employees prevented from installing unauthorized software in practice?
- How are new software requests handled and approved?
- How are staff informed about these restrictions?
- Can you provide examples of how unauthorized installation attempts are detected or blocked?

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), written policies may be brief, but technical controls (e.g., standard user accounts) should still be in place.
- In micro-businesses, a simple documented process (e.g., “only the owner can install software”) may suffice if enforced.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Expect practical, low-cost controls (e.g., using built-in OS permissions, free email filtering).
- Do not require enterprise-level solutions, but basic controls must be present.

### **Industry Context**
- Sectors handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter controls.
- For organizations with field staff or BYOD, look for mobile device management or clear guidance on personal device use.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Policies exist but are not enforced or communicated.
- Technical controls only on some devices.
- Over-reliance on user awareness without supporting controls.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Policies are outdated or not organization-specific.
- Evidence is anecdotal or lacks proof of implementation.

### **False Positives**
- Responses that describe intentions (“we plan to restrict installations”) but lack current implementation.
- Screenshots or documents that do not match the described environment.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Are there documented or technical controls restricting installation/access to authorized software/attachments?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed
2. **Are these controls enforced and communicated to staff?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance (if some evidence exists)
   - **Yes:** Proceed
3. **Is there credible, current evidence supporting these claims?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance
   - **Yes:** PASS

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers the organization, request additional evidence or clarification.
- Escalate to senior auditor if organization claims “unique” circumstances or if evidence is contradictory.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size or sector.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, enforced measures—both policy and technical—that prevent unauthorized software/attachment installation or access, supported by credible evidence. Responses lacking controls, enforcement, or evidence should be marked as FAIL, with partial compliance noted for incomplete implementations. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but basic controls must always be present.
