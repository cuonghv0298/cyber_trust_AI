# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4a  
**Clause: Backup – Back up essential data and store them offline**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must:
- Identify its business-critical systems and essential business information (i.e., what is vital for business recovery after a cyber incident).
- Perform regular backups of this data.
- Store backups offline (i.e., not continuously connected to the main network or systems).

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Ensure business continuity and rapid recovery after a cyber incident (e.g., ransomware, data corruption, accidental deletion).
- Minimize data loss and operational downtime.
- Prevent backup compromise by isolating backup copies from live systems.

**Context & Importance:**  
Backups are a fundamental defense against data loss from cyberattacks, hardware failure, or human error. Storing backups offline reduces the risk that malware or attackers can access or destroy backup copies.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has **identified** business-critical systems and essential data for backup.
- There is **evidence of regular backups** (at least weekly, or more frequent if justified by business needs).
- Backups are **stored offline** (e.g., on external drives disconnected after backup, or in a secure cloud service with versioning and access controls).
- There is a **backup plan or policy** covering systems/data included, backup frequency, storage method/location, and recovery process.
- The organization can **demonstrate** that backup data is protected (e.g., encrypted, access-controlled).

### FAIL Criteria
- No identification of what data/systems are critical or essential.
- No evidence of regular backups, or backups are ad-hoc/irregular.
- Backups are only stored online or on the same network as production systems (e.g., mapped network drives, always-connected NAS).
- No backup plan/policy, or policy is generic and not implemented.
- No mention or evidence of backup data protection (e.g., unencrypted, accessible to all staff).

### Partial Compliance
- Some but not all critical systems/data are backed up.
- Backups are performed but not stored offline (e.g., only in cloud storage without proper isolation).
- Policy exists but is not fully implemented or lacks key details.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- List or inventory of business-critical systems and essential data.
- Backup schedules/logs/screenshots showing regular backup activity.
- Description or diagram of backup storage (e.g., external drives, cloud service, physical location).
- Backup policy or plan document.
- Evidence of encryption or access controls on backup data.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **current** (within the last 3-6 months).
- Documentation should be **specific** (names of systems/data, backup frequency, storage method).
- Screenshots/logs should show **dates/times** and **successful backup completion**.
- Policy documents should be **dated** and **approved** by management.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not organization-specific.
- Backups are described but not demonstrated (no logs/screenshots).
- Policy exists but no proof of implementation.
- Backups stored on always-connected devices or in insecure locations.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: Any backup solution for critical services and data?
- **What to Look For:** Clear identification of what is backed up and how.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "We back up our accounting system and customer database daily to an encrypted external hard drive, which is disconnected after backup."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "We do backups sometimes." / "We use Google Drive for everything."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "Which systems/data are included in your backups? How do you ensure backups are not accessible to attackers?"

### Q2: Are backups performed regularly and stored securely?
- **What to Look For:** Frequency (e.g., daily, weekly), storage method (offline, encrypted).
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Backups are performed every night and stored on a USB drive kept in a locked cabinet."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "Backups are on a shared network folder." / "We back up when we remember."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How often are backups performed? Where are backup copies physically stored?"

### Q3: What is the backup plan if systems are down or affected?
- **What to Look For:** Existence of a documented plan for recovery.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "We have a written backup and recovery plan that outlines steps to restore data from offline backups."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "We would try to recover from the cloud." / "No formal plan."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "Can you provide a copy of your backup/recovery plan? When was it last tested?"

### Q4: Is there a formal backup policy (systems covered, frequency, storage, recovery testing)?
- **What to Look For:** Existence and content of policy.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Our backup policy (attached) covers all critical systems, requires daily backups, offline storage, and quarterly recovery tests."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "No written policy." / "Policy says to back up, but no details."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "When was the policy last reviewed? Who is responsible for backups?"

### Q5: Are backup data encrypted?
- **What to Look For:** Encryption in storage and/or transit.
- **Acceptable Responses:** "Backups are encrypted using AES-256 before being stored offline."
- **Unacceptable Responses:** "No, backups are not encrypted." / "Not sure."
- **Follow-up Questions:** "How is encryption managed? Who has access to the encryption keys?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), simple solutions (e.g., manual backups to external drives, basic written policy) are acceptable if they meet the core requirements.
- Larger organizations should have more formalized and automated solutions.

### Resource Constraints
- "Reasonable effort" means regular manual backups are acceptable if automated solutions are not feasible, provided they are documented and consistently performed.
- Use of reputable cloud backup services is acceptable if they provide versioning, access controls, and are not continuously mapped to the main network.

### Industry Context
- Highly regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more frequent backups and stricter controls.
- For organizations handling sensitive data, encryption and physical security of backups are especially important.

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only some data/systems are backed up; others are overlooked.
- Backups are stored on devices always connected to the network (vulnerable to ransomware).
- No clear identification of what is "essential" for business recovery.

### Documentation Issues
- Policies are generic, outdated, or not tailored to the organization.
- No evidence of actual backup activity (e.g., missing logs/screenshots).

### False Positives
- Responses claim backups are done but provide no supporting evidence.
- Cloud storage is used as backup, but without proper isolation or access controls.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Has the organization identified business-critical systems and essential data?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Are regular backups performed and documented?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Are backups stored offline or in a manner isolated from production systems?**
   - If NO → FAIL
4. **Is there a backup plan/policy covering scope, frequency, storage, and recovery?**
   - If NO → FAIL
5. **Is backup data protected (e.g., encrypted, access-controlled)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
6. **Is evidence current, specific, and credible?**
   - If NO → FAIL
7. **If all YES → PASS**

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or contradictory, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide evidence, escalate to senior auditor for review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scaling based on size and resources.
- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, referencing specific evidence and responses.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear identification of essential data/systems, regular and documented backup activity, offline or isolated storage, a written backup plan/policy, and protection of backup data. Evidence must be specific, current, and credible. Adjust expectations for smaller organizations, but do not compromise on the core requirement: essential data must be regularly backed up and stored offline to ensure business recovery after a cyber incident.
