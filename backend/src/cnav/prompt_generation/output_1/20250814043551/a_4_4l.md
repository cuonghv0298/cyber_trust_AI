            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4l  
**Clause**: Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Protect from malicious software like viruses and malware  
**Provision**: The organisation shall ensure that its employees are aware of the need to report any suspicious email or attachment to the IT team and/or senior management immediately.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must ensure that all employees know they are required to promptly report any suspicious emails or attachments to the designated IT team or, if no IT team exists, to senior management. This awareness should be organization-wide, not limited to IT staff.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Early detection and containment of phishing, malware, and other email-borne threats.
- Minimizing the risk of malware infection or data compromise by ensuring rapid escalation of suspicious activity.
- Fostering a security-aware culture where employees act as the first line of defense.

**Context & Importance:**  
Email is a primary vector for cyberattacks. Prompt reporting of suspicious emails enables organizations to respond quickly, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks and limiting potential damage. For resource-constrained organizations, employee vigilance is critical.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides clear evidence that employees are **aware** of the requirement to report suspicious emails/attachments **immediately** to IT or senior management.
- There is a **defined reporting channel** (e.g., email address, phone number, escalation process).
- Awareness is **demonstrated across all staff**, not just IT personnel.
- Evidence (if provided) is **current** (within the last 12 months).

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence or only vague statements about employee awareness.
- Reporting requirement is not communicated to all staff.
- No defined reporting channel or process.
- Evidence is outdated, irrelevant, or missing.

### Partial Compliance
- Some, but not all, employees are aware (e.g., only new hires or only IT staff).
- Reporting process exists but is informal or inconsistently communicated.
- Evidence suggests awareness but lacks clarity or completeness.
- In such cases, request further evidence or clarification.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Training materials** (slides, handouts, emails) referencing suspicious email reporting.
- **Employee communications** (memos, newsletters, intranet posts) outlining the reporting requirement.
- **Policy documents** or staff handbooks mentioning the process.
- **Screenshots** of reminders or instructions (e.g., posters, email banners).
- **Sample incident reports** (with sensitive data redacted) showing actual reporting.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be **specific** to the reporting of suspicious emails/attachments.
- Should cover **all staff** (not just IT or management).
- Must be **recent** (within the last year).
- Should clearly indicate **how** and **to whom** to report.

### Red Flags
- Generic security awareness materials with no mention of reporting.
- Evidence only covers a subset of employees.
- Outdated documents (older than 12 months).
- No proof of communication or training.
- Fabricated or template evidence with no organization-specific details.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Explicit mention in responses that **all employees** are informed about reporting suspicious emails/attachments.
- Description of **how** employees are made aware (e.g., induction, annual training, regular reminders).
- Details of the **reporting process** (who to contact, how to report).
- Evidence that communication is **ongoing** (not a one-off).

### Acceptable Responses
- "All staff receive annual cybersecurity training that includes instructions to report suspicious emails to IT at it-support@company.com or, if unavailable, to the General Manager."
- "We have a policy in our employee handbook (see attached excerpt) requiring immediate reporting of suspicious emails to the IT lead."
- "Monthly email reminders are sent to all staff, and posters are displayed in the office (see attached photo)."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "Our IT team knows to report suspicious emails."
- "We tell new hires about phishing, but there is no formal process."
- "Employees can report if they want, but it's not required."
- "No evidence provided."

### Follow-up Questions
- How is this requirement communicated to existing staff and new hires?
- Can you provide a sample communication or training material?
- How often is this information reinforced or refreshed?
- Who is responsible for receiving and acting on these reports?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- **Very small organizations** (e.g., <10 staff): Accept informal but clear communication (e.g., group chat message, verbal briefing with written confirmation).
- **Larger organizations**: Expect more formalized communication (e.g., documented policy, regular training).

### Resource Constraints
- Accept low-cost or simple awareness methods (e.g., email, posters, short briefings) as long as they are effective and reach all staff.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with higher email risk (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more frequent reminders.
- For organizations with no dedicated IT, reporting to senior management is acceptable.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only IT staff are aware of the reporting requirement.
- No evidence of communication to non-IT staff.
- Reporting process is unclear or not documented.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is outdated or generic.
- No proof that all staff are covered.
- Missing or incomplete artifacts.

### False Positives
- Responses that mention general awareness but do not specify reporting requirements.
- Evidence of security training with no reference to reporting suspicious emails.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence that all employees are aware of the need to report suspicious emails/attachments immediately?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Is there a defined reporting process/channel (to IT or senior management)?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is the evidence recent (within 12 months) and organization-specific?**
   - **No** → FAIL or Partial (request update)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers staff, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes requirement or provides conflicting information.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Use provided examples to calibrate judgments across assessments.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must show that all employees are aware of the need to report suspicious emails/attachments immediately, with a clear process and recent, credible evidence. Responses lacking specificity, coverage, or current evidence should FAIL or be flagged for further review. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the core requirement of organization-wide awareness and reporting.
