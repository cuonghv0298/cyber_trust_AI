# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4f  
**(Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Firewalls to protect network, systems, and endpoints)**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must have firewalls deployed and enabled to protect their network, systems, and endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops, servers, virtual environments). Where an organizational network exists, a network perimeter firewall must be configured to analyze and accept only authorized network traffic. Firewalls may be standalone devices or integrated into other networking equipment (e.g., routers, unified threat management devices). Firewall rules should restrict and filter network traffic, blocking unauthorized or malicious connections.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access to internal systems and data.
- Block malicious or suspicious network traffic.
- Limit exposure to external threats by controlling inbound and outbound connections.

**Context & Importance:**  
Firewalls are a foundational security control, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity expertise. They provide a first line of defense against common cyberattacks by filtering traffic and blocking known threats, reducing the risk of compromise from external sources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Firewalls are deployed and enabled on all relevant endpoints (laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines).
- Where an organizational network exists, a perimeter firewall is present and actively configured.
- Firewall rules are in place to restrict unauthorized inbound and outbound traffic.
- The organization can describe or show how firewall rules are set to block malicious IPs or filter suspicious traffic.
- Evidence demonstrates that only authorized network traffic is allowed into the organization’s network.

### FAIL Criteria
- No firewalls are deployed or enabled on endpoints or network perimeter.
- Firewall is present but not configured (default/allow-all settings).
- No evidence of firewall rules restricting or filtering traffic.
- Organization cannot describe or provide evidence of how firewalls are used to block malicious traffic.
- Firewall is disabled or not maintained.

### Partial Compliance
- Firewalls are present but only partially configured (e.g., enabled on some but not all endpoints).
- Firewall rules exist but are overly permissive or not regularly reviewed.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of firewall settings on endpoints and/or network devices.
- Exported firewall rule lists or configuration summaries.
- Network diagrams showing firewall placement.
- Policy documents or SOPs referencing firewall management.
- Device inventory showing firewall-enabled devices.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 6 months).
- Screenshots/configurations must clearly show firewall status and rule sets.
- Documentation should match the organization’s described network setup.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not organization-specific.
- Screenshots show default/allow-all rules.
- No evidence of firewall rules or only references to “having a firewall” without detail.
- Evidence is inconsistent with the organization’s size or IT environment.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: Is there a firewall? Are rules in place to filter malicious traffic and block malicious IPs?

**What to Look For:**
- Confirmation that firewalls are enabled on all relevant devices.
- Description or evidence of rules that block or filter malicious traffic/IPs.

**Acceptable Responses:**
- “Yes, all company laptops and desktops have Windows Defender Firewall enabled with default-deny inbound rules.”
- “Our office router has a firewall enabled with rules to block known malicious IPs and restrict inbound traffic to VPN only.”
- Screenshot of firewall rule list showing blocked ports/IPs.

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- “We have a router from our ISP, but we don’t know if the firewall is on.”
- “We rely on antivirus only.”
- No mention of rules or filtering.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- Can you provide a screenshot or export of your firewall rules?
- How do you update or review your firewall rules?
- Are all endpoints protected, including remote workers?

---

### Q2: Is there firewall configured to accept only authorised network traffic into the organisation network?

**What to Look For:**
- Evidence of a perimeter firewall (if applicable) with rules restricting inbound traffic.
- Description of what “authorized” traffic means for the organization.

**Acceptable Responses:**
- “Our perimeter firewall only allows inbound VPN connections; all other inbound traffic is blocked.”
- “We have a DNS firewall that blocks access to known malicious domains.”
- Screenshot of firewall configuration showing restricted inbound rules.

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- “We allow all inbound traffic.”
- “We don’t know what traffic is allowed.”
- No evidence of configuration.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- What types of inbound connections are permitted, and why?
- How do you ensure only authorized traffic is allowed?
- Who manages and reviews firewall configurations?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For micro/small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), built-in OS firewalls (Windows/Mac) and ISP-provided router firewalls are acceptable if properly configured.
- For larger organizations or those with a dedicated office network, a perimeter firewall is expected.

### Resource Constraints
- Expect simple, practical implementations (e.g., default-deny inbound, basic rule sets).
- Do not require enterprise-grade firewall appliances unless justified by organization size/complexity.

### Industry Context
- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter firewall configurations.
- Remote-only organizations may rely on endpoint firewalls rather than a network perimeter device.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Firewalls enabled but with default/allow-all rules.
- Only some devices protected.
- No regular review or update of firewall rules.

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots not showing relevant settings.
- Evidence from personal/home devices instead of organizational assets.
- Outdated or missing documentation.

### False Positives
- Stating “firewall is enabled” without evidence of rule configuration.
- Confusing antivirus with firewall functionality.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is a firewall present and enabled on all relevant devices?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Are firewall rules configured to restrict unauthorized/malicious traffic?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Is there evidence (screenshots, configs, policies) supporting the above?**
   - If NO or insufficient → FAIL or Partial (request more info)
4. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**
   - If NO → FAIL or Partial (request more info)
5. **If all YES → PASS**

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If organization claims unique circumstances (e.g., all cloud-based, no internal network), escalate for review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria for similar organization types and sizes.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, current evidence that firewalls are enabled and configured to restrict unauthorized/malicious traffic on all relevant devices and networks. Responses must go beyond simply stating “firewall is enabled” and should demonstrate practical implementation appropriate to the organization’s size and resources. Incomplete, outdated, or generic responses should be followed up or marked as FAIL. Consistency and proportionality are key—ensure requirements are scaled to the organization’s context while maintaining baseline security standards.
