# Evaluation Prompt for A.9.4a
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.9.4a

            ## Provision ID
            A.9.4a

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must have a **basic, up-to-date incident response plan (IRP)** that guides how to detect, respond to, and recover from common cybersecurity incidents (e.g., phishing, ransomware, data breach). The plan must clearly define:
- **Roles and responsibilities** of key personnel involved in incident response.
- **Step-by-step procedures** for detection, response, and recovery from typical cyber threats.
- A **communication plan** with timelines for escalating and reporting incidents to relevant internal and external stakeholders (e.g., management, regulators, customers).

**Key Security Objectives:**
- Ensure the organization can **quickly identify and contain incidents** to minimize damage.
- Enable **coordinated and effective response** by assigning clear responsibilities.
- Maintain **transparency and compliance** through timely communication with stakeholders.

**Why This Matters:**  
Without a clear, actionable IRP, organizations are likely to respond slowly or ineffectively to incidents, increasing the risk of data loss, business disruption, regulatory penalties, and reputational harm.

---

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization provides a **written incident response plan** (document, policy, or procedure) that is **current** (reviewed/updated within the last 12 months).
- The plan **explicitly lists roles and responsibilities** (e.g., who leads the response, who communicates with stakeholders, who investigates).
- The plan includes **detection, response, and recovery procedures** for at least the following scenarios: phishing, ransomware, and data breach.
- There is a **communication/escalation plan** with clear timelines and identification of who is notified (internally and externally).
- Employees are **aware of how to report suspicious activity** (e.g., phishing emails).

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No incident response plan exists, or only informal/unwritten processes are described.
- The plan is **outdated** (not reviewed in the last 12 months) or missing key elements (roles, procedures, communication).
- The plan is generic, lacks actionable steps, or does not address common threat scenarios.
- No evidence of employee awareness or reporting process for incidents.

### **Partial Compliance**
- The plan exists but is missing one or more required elements (e.g., no communication plan, unclear roles).
- The plan is not tailored to the organization’s actual structure or operations.
- The plan is in draft form or not yet communicated to staff.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- **Incident Response Plan document** (policy, procedure, or playbook).
- **Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan** (if referenced as part of IRP).
- **Employee communications/training records** (e.g., email, intranet post, training slides) showing staff are informed about reporting procedures.
- **Incident reporting forms or logs** (if available).

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- **Specificity:** The plan should reference the organization’s actual structure, not generic templates.
- **Currency:** The plan should show a recent review date (within 12 months).
- **Completeness:** All required elements (roles, procedures, communication) are present.
- **Accessibility:** The plan is available to relevant staff.

### **Red Flags**
- Plan is a downloaded template with no customization.
- No evidence of review or update.
- Plan is missing key sections or is only a high-level statement.
- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or inconsistent with organization size/structure.

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **Q1: Is there a process for employees to report suspicious emails or attachments?**
- **What to Look For:** Clear description of how employees report (e.g., dedicated email, helpdesk ticket, escalation to IT).
- **Acceptable Responses:** “Employees forward suspicious emails to itsecurity@company.com”; “Staff are trained to use the ‘Report Phishing’ button.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “Staff know to be careful”; “We tell people to be vigilant” (no process described).
- **Follow-up Questions:** How are employees informed of this process? Is there evidence of recent communication or training?

### **Q2: Do floods or other natural occurrences affect operations? If so, what is the disaster-recovery plan?**
- **What to Look For:** Reference to disaster recovery/business continuity as part of the IRP, especially for data loss scenarios.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “Our BCP includes recovery steps for data loss due to disasters”; “Backups are stored offsite.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “We don’t have a plan”; “Not applicable” (if physical risks are present).
- **Follow-up Questions:** Is the disaster recovery plan integrated with the incident response plan?

### **Q3: Is there a business-continuity plan in place?**
- **What to Look For:** Existence of a BCP that complements the IRP, especially for recovery from major incidents.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, see attached BCP document.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No”; “We rely on ad-hoc measures.”
- **Follow-up Questions:** How does the BCP link to the incident response process?

### **Q4: Is there an incident-response plan (IRP) for cybersecurity and data breaches?**
- **What to Look For:** Existence of a documented IRP covering cyber incidents.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, see attached IRP”; “Our IRP covers phishing, ransomware, and data breaches.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No formal plan”; “We handle incidents as they arise.”
- **Follow-up Questions:** When was the IRP last reviewed or updated?

### **Q5: Does the incident-response plan include responsibilities of key personnel, procedures to detect, respond and recover from the threat and a communication timeline?**
- **What to Look For:** Plan sections or tables listing roles, step-by-step procedures, and communication/escalation timelines.
- **Acceptable Responses:** “The IRP assigns the IT Manager as Incident Lead, details steps for isolating affected systems, and includes a notification matrix.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “We all help out as needed”; “No specific roles or timelines.”
- **Follow-up Questions:** Who is responsible for each step? How are external parties notified?

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations, a concise IRP (1–2 pages) is acceptable if it covers all required elements.
- Roles may be combined (e.g., owner is also IT lead), but must be explicitly stated.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Simple, practical procedures are acceptable (e.g., “call IT support”).
- Use of checklists or flowcharts is encouraged for clarity.

### **Industry Context**
- Highly regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more detailed communication plans.
- For organizations with no customer data, focus on internal escalation and recovery.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- IRP is missing or only covers IT outages, not cyber incidents.
- No assignment of roles or unclear responsibilities.
- No communication/escalation plan.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Plan is outdated or undated.
- Evidence is a generic template with no organization-specific details.
- No proof that staff are aware of the plan.

### **False Positives**
- Responses claim a plan exists but provide no supporting document.
- Plan mentions “cybersecurity” but only covers physical disasters.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Is there a documented IRP covering cyber incidents?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Continue
2. **Does the IRP assign roles/responsibilities, include procedures for detection/response/recovery, and a communication plan with timelines?**
   - **No:** FAIL or PARTIAL (if some elements present)
   - **Yes:** Continue
3. **Is the IRP current (reviewed/updated within 12 months) and organization-specific?**
   - **No:** PARTIAL (request update)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes requirements or if sector-specific obligations are unclear.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for any PARTIAL or escalated cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a concise, up-to-date, and actionable incident response plan that clearly assigns roles, outlines procedures for common cyber threats, and includes a communication/escalation process. Evidence must be organization-specific and demonstrate staff awareness. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not accept missing or generic plans. Use the decision tree to ensure consistent, fair, and thorough assessments.
