---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.7.4b  
**Clause:** Update: Software updates – Update software on devices and systems  
**Provision Requirement:** The organisation should carry out compatibility tests on updates for operating system and applications before installing them.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must perform compatibility testing on updates (for both operating systems and applications) before deploying them to production devices and systems. This means that, prior to installation, updates are checked to ensure they do not disrupt critical business functions or cause software/hardware conflicts.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent business disruption due to faulty or incompatible updates.
- Ensure updates do not introduce new vulnerabilities or operational issues.
- Maintain system stability and availability after updates.

**Context & Importance:**  
Unvetted updates can cause system outages, application failures, or data loss. Even small organizations can be severely impacted if an update breaks a critical function. Compatibility testing, even if basic, helps ensure updates are safe to deploy and supports business continuity.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization demonstrates a defined process for compatibility testing of updates before installation.
- Evidence shows that updates are tested on at least one non-production device or environment before being rolled out organization-wide.
- The process covers both operating system and application updates.
- The approach is proportionate to the organization’s size and resources (e.g., manual testing on a spare device for small organizations).

### FAIL Criteria
- No compatibility testing is performed before updates are installed.
- The organization relies solely on automatic updates without any form of pre-deployment testing.
- The process is described only in theory, with no supporting evidence or examples.
- Testing is limited to only some updates (e.g., only OS, not applications) without justification.

### Partial Compliance
- Testing is performed inconsistently or only for major updates.
- The process is informal or ad-hoc, with limited documentation or evidence.
- The organization tests only on a subset of devices or applications, with some rationale (e.g., resource constraints), but lacks a plan to address gaps.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedures or policies describing compatibility testing steps.
- Screenshots, logs, or records showing test updates applied to non-production devices.
- Change management records or update logs indicating testing activities.
- Examples of past updates where compatibility testing was performed.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Documentation should be clear, specific, and relevant to the organization’s environment.
- Screenshots or logs should show dates, device names, and update details.

### Red Flags
- Vague statements such as “we test updates” without specifics.
- Outdated or generic documentation not tailored to the organization.
- Evidence that only covers one type of update (e.g., OS but not applications).
- No evidence of actual testing (only policy documents).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Description of how updates are tested for compatibility before installation.
- Identification of who is responsible for testing.
- Evidence of testing on non-production or spare devices.
- Coverage of both operating system and application updates.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We have a spare laptop where all Windows and Office updates are installed and tested for a week before rolling out to staff devices. Screenshots of update history and test logs are attached.”
- “For our accounting software, updates are first installed on a test machine. If no issues are found after 2 days, we update the main system. See attached change log.”
- “Our IT vendor tests all updates in a virtual environment before deployment. See attached vendor report.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We just install updates as soon as they are available.”
- “Updates are automatic; we don’t test them.”
- “We trust the vendor to ensure compatibility.”
- “We only test major updates, not all updates.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide an example of a recent update and how it was tested for compatibility?”
- “How do you handle updates for critical business applications?”
- “What steps are taken if a compatibility issue is found during testing?”
- “Who is responsible for conducting these tests?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, testing on a single spare device or during off-hours on a primary device is acceptable.
- Formal test environments are not required; practical, low-cost approaches are sufficient.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual testing is acceptable if automated tools or dedicated test environments are not feasible.
- Reasonable effort means at least basic testing is performed before updates are widely deployed.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with specialized or legacy applications should demonstrate extra care in testing.
- Sectors with regulatory or operational dependencies (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more thorough testing.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming vendor or automatic updates are always safe without testing.
- Only testing operating system updates, neglecting applications.
- No documentation or records of testing activities.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence showing actual testing (e.g., only policies, no logs).
- Evidence is outdated or not relevant to current systems.

### False Positives
- Responses that describe a process but provide no proof it is followed.
- Evidence that is generic or copied from templates.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a process for compatibility testing before installing updates?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

2. **Is there evidence that this process is followed (e.g., logs, screenshots, records)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

3. **Does the process cover both operating system and application updates?**
   - If NO, but justified and risk is low → Partial Compliance (seek clarification)
   - If NO, and unjustified → FAIL
   - If YES → PASS

4. **Is the approach proportionate to the organization’s size and resources?**
   - If YES → PASS
   - If NO → Partial Compliance or FAIL

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or only partially meets requirements, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims exceptions due to business needs, seek justification and supporting documentation.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.
- Ensure evidence is recent and directly relevant to the provision.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical evidence that the organization tests updates for compatibility before installation, covering both OS and applications, with an approach scaled to their size and resources. Lack of evidence, reliance on automatic updates without testing, or incomplete coverage should result in a FAIL or require further investigation.
