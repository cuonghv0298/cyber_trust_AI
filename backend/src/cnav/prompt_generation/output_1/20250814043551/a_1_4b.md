# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.1.4b  
**Clause: Assets: People – Equip employees with know-how to be the first line of defence**  
**Provision Requirement:** Cyber hygiene practices and guidelines shall be developed for employees to adopt in their daily operations.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must have developed and documented basic cyber hygiene practices and guidelines that are communicated to all employees. These should cover essential, practical steps staff must follow to protect the organization from common cyber threats in their daily work (e.g., password management, phishing awareness, safe internet use, device security).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all employees are aware of and follow minimum cybersecurity practices.
- Reduce risk of human error leading to security incidents.
- Establish a baseline of security-conscious behavior across the organization.

**Why This Matters:**  
Employees are often targeted by attackers (e.g., phishing, social engineering). Clear, accessible guidelines empower staff to recognize and respond to threats, making them an effective first line of defence.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has developed written or digital cyber hygiene guidelines for employees.
- Guidelines are relevant to the organization’s operations and cover key topics (e.g., password use, email safety, device security, reporting incidents).
- Guidelines are accessible to all employees (e.g., via handbook, intranet, posters, onboarding materials).
- Evidence shows guidelines are current (reviewed/updated within the last 12 months).

### FAIL Criteria
- No documented guidelines exist, or only informal/unwritten practices are described.
- Guidelines are generic, outdated, or irrelevant to the organization’s context.
- Employees are not aware of any such guidelines, or there is no evidence of communication/dissemination.

### Partial Compliance
- Guidelines exist but are incomplete (e.g., missing key topics, not tailored to daily operations).
- Guidelines are outdated (not reviewed in the last 12 months).
- Evidence of guidelines exists, but unclear if all employees have access or are aware.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Copies of cyber hygiene guidelines, policies, or handbooks.
- Screenshots of intranet pages, emails, or training materials referencing the guidelines.
- Records of guideline dissemination (e.g., onboarding checklists, staff emails).
- Evidence of recent review or update (e.g., document version history, review dates).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be organization-specific, not generic templates.
- Guidelines should be clear, concise, and understandable for non-technical staff.
- Evidence should demonstrate both existence and communication of guidelines.

### Red Flags
- Only policy titles or table of contents provided, without actual content.
- Evidence is a generic template with no customization.
- Guidelines are dated more than 12 months ago with no sign of review.
- No evidence of employee access or awareness.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Existence of documented cyber hygiene guidelines.
- Coverage of key topics relevant to daily operations.
- Evidence that guidelines are communicated and accessible to all staff.
- Recent review or update of guidelines.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We have a cyber hygiene handbook distributed to all staff, covering password management, phishing, device security, and reporting procedures. Last updated March 2024. See attached PDF and onboarding checklist.”
- “Guidelines are posted on our intranet and included in new hire orientation. See screenshots and sample orientation agenda.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We tell staff to be careful with emails, but there is nothing written down.”
- “We have a policy, but it’s from 2021 and hasn’t been updated.”
- “Staff are expected to use common sense; no formal guidelines exist.”

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide a copy or screenshot of the guidelines?
- How are these guidelines communicated to new and existing staff?
- When were the guidelines last reviewed or updated?
- How do you ensure all employees are aware of and understand these guidelines?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple one-page guideline or checklist is acceptable if it covers key topics and is shared with all staff.
- Formal training is not required, but evidence of communication (e.g., email, printed notice) is expected.

### Resource Constraints
- Guidelines do not need to be lengthy or complex; clarity and relevance are more important.
- Use of free government or industry resources is acceptable if adapted to the organization’s context.

### Industry Context
- Guidelines should reflect sector-specific risks (e.g., handling customer data in retail, remote work in professional services).
- Highly technical requirements are not expected for non-IT staff.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Guidelines exist but are not communicated to all staff.
- Only IT staff receive guidelines; non-technical staff are excluded.
- Guidelines are too generic or copied from external sources without adaptation.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated documents with no evidence of review.
- Only policy names or summaries provided, not the actual content.

### False Positives
- Organization claims to have guidelines but cannot produce evidence.
- Guidelines exist but are not relevant to daily employee activities.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are documented cyber hygiene guidelines present?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

2. **Do guidelines cover key topics relevant to daily operations?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

3. **Are guidelines accessible and communicated to all employees?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

4. **Are guidelines current (reviewed/updated within 12 months)?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request update/review evidence)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes requirements or provides conflicting information.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scaling based on size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must provide evidence of clear, current, and communicated cyber hygiene guidelines relevant to employees’ daily operations. Auditors should look for practical, accessible documentation and evidence of dissemination, considering the organization’s size and resources. Incomplete, outdated, or generic responses should result in FAIL or require further investigation.
