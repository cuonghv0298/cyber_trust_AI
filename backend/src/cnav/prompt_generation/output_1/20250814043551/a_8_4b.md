# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4b  
**Clause:** Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline  
**Provision Requirement:** The backups shall be performed on a regular basis, with the backup frequency aligned to the business requirements and how many days’ worth of data the organisation can afford to lose.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must regularly back up their essential data. The frequency of these backups should be determined by the organization’s business needs and the maximum acceptable amount of data loss (i.e., Recovery Point Objective, RPO). For example, if the business can only afford to lose one day’s worth of data, backups should occur at least daily.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure critical business data can be restored in the event of data loss (e.g., ransomware, accidental deletion, hardware failure).
- Minimize operational disruption by aligning backup frequency with business risk tolerance.
- Support business continuity and resilience.

**Context/Importance:**  
Regular, business-aligned backups are a fundamental defense against data loss. Without them, organizations risk losing essential information, which can severely impact operations, reputation, and compliance.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization performs backups on a regular, defined schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).
- The backup frequency is explicitly justified based on business requirements and data loss tolerance (e.g., “We back up daily because we can only afford to lose one day’s data”).
- There is evidence that the backup schedule is followed in practice (e.g., backup logs, schedules, or policies).
- Essential data (not just some data) is included in the backup scope.

### FAIL Criteria
- No regular backup schedule is in place, or backups are performed only ad hoc.
- The backup frequency is arbitrary or not linked to business needs/data loss tolerance.
- No evidence is provided to support claims of regular backups.
- Only partial or non-essential data is backed up.

### Partial Compliance
- Backups are performed, but the frequency is not clearly justified or only loosely tied to business requirements.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some essential data.
- The backup schedule is in place but not consistently followed (e.g., missed backups).

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Backup schedules or policies (formal or informal, e.g., a written schedule, calendar reminders).
- Backup logs or reports showing recent backup activity.
- Screenshots of backup software or cloud backup dashboards.
- Documentation or statements explaining how backup frequency was determined.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 1-2 months).
- Evidence should clearly show the frequency and scope of backups.
- Explanations should be specific (e.g., “We back up every night at 2am because our business can only tolerate 24 hours of data loss”).

### Red Flags
- Vague statements (“We back up regularly”) with no supporting details.
- Outdated evidence (e.g., backup logs from over 3 months ago).
- Evidence that only covers non-essential or test data.
- No linkage between backup frequency and business/data loss tolerance.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- A clear description of backup frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).
- A rationale for the chosen frequency, tied to business needs or data loss tolerance.
- Evidence that backups are actually being performed as described.
- Confirmation that all essential data is included.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We perform daily backups of all essential business data because we cannot afford to lose more than one day’s work. See attached backup logs from the last two weeks.”
- “Our business can tolerate up to 3 days of data loss, so we back up every 48 hours. Attached is our backup schedule and screenshots from our backup software.”
- “We have a weekly backup policy, as our operations can recover from up to 7 days of data loss. Here is our policy document and recent backup reports.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We back up when we remember to.”
- “We back up sometimes, but don’t have a set schedule.”
- “We only back up our finance folder, not all essential data.”
- “No evidence provided.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “How did you determine your backup frequency?”
- “What data is included in your backups?”
- “Can you provide recent backup logs or screenshots?”
- “Who is responsible for ensuring backups are performed?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, informal schedules (e.g., calendar reminders, manual logs) are acceptable if they are consistently followed.
- The backup method can be simple (e.g., copying files to an external drive) as long as it is regular and covers essential data.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means the organization should have a practical, sustainable backup routine, even if it is manual.
- Automated solutions are not required, but regularity and coverage are.

### Industry Context
- Organizations handling sensitive or regulated data may require more frequent backups.
- For sectors with low data change rates, less frequent backups may be justified if properly explained.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- No formal or informal backup schedule.
- Backups only cover a subset of essential data.
- Backup frequency not linked to business needs.

### Documentation Issues
- Missing or outdated backup logs.
- Lack of evidence showing actual backup activity.

### False Positives
- Stating “we back up regularly” without evidence or justification.
- Providing evidence of a single backup event, not a pattern.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a regular backup schedule?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Is the backup frequency justified by business requirements/data loss tolerance?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Is there recent evidence showing backups are performed as scheduled?**
   - If NO → FAIL
4. **Are all essential data included in the backups?**
   - If NO → FAIL
5. **If all YES → PASS**

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any evidence, escalate to a senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and justification across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a regular, justified backup routine that matches the organization’s business needs, supported by recent and credible evidence. Responses lacking clear schedules, justification, or evidence should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the requirement for regular, business-aligned backups of all essential data.
