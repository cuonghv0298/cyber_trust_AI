# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.9.4d  
**Clause:** Respond: Incident response – Be ready to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents  
**Provision:** As good practice, the incident response plan should be reviewed at least annually.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must review their incident response plan (IRP) at least once every 12 months. This review should ensure the plan remains current, effective, and relevant to the organization’s operations, risks, and IT environment.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure the IRP reflects current threats, business processes, and contact information.
- Confirm that staff know their roles and responsibilities during an incident.
- Identify and address gaps or outdated procedures in the plan.

**Context & Importance:**  
Regular review of the IRP is critical to ensure the organization can respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents. As threats and organizational structures change, an outdated plan can lead to confusion, delays, or ineffective responses, increasing the risk of business disruption or data loss.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides clear evidence that the IRP has been reviewed within the past 12 months.
- The review is documented (e.g., meeting minutes, review log, updated plan with revision date).
- The review process is described, even if simple (e.g., checklist, discussion at staff meeting).
- The organization can identify who was involved in the review.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of an IRP review within the last 12 months.
- The IRP exists but has not been reviewed or updated in over a year.
- The organization cannot describe or demonstrate any review process.
- The review is claimed but not documented in any way.

### Partial Compliance
- The IRP was reviewed, but evidence is ambiguous (e.g., undated notes, verbal claims only).
- The review occurred slightly outside the 12-month window (e.g., 13-14 months ago).
- The review was superficial (e.g., only a signature, no indication of actual review).

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- IRP document with a revision/review date.
- Meeting minutes or emails referencing the review.
- Change log or version history showing annual updates.
- Staff communications confirming review (e.g., email to team).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be dated and clearly linked to the IRP review.
- Evidence should show some level of engagement (not just a date change).
- Accept simple documentation for small organizations (e.g., a signed/dated cover page).

### Red Flags
- IRP with no date or version history.
- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or generic.
- Review is claimed but no supporting documentation is provided.
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical content with only the date changed).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- A clear statement that the IRP is reviewed at least annually.
- Supporting evidence showing the last review date within the past 12 months.
- Description of who conducted the review and what was checked.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Our IRP was reviewed on [date within last 12 months]. See attached meeting minutes and updated plan.”
- “We review the IRP every January during our annual IT meeting. Attached is the signed checklist from the last review.”
- “The IRP was updated on [date], as shown in the document’s version history.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We have an IRP, but we haven’t reviewed it recently.”
- “We review it when needed, but there’s no record.”
- “We don’t have a formal review process.”
- “The IRP was last reviewed over a year ago.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide documentation or evidence of the last IRP review?”
- “Who was involved in the review, and what changes (if any) were made?”
- “How do you ensure the IRP remains up to date?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple signed and dated note or email confirming the review is acceptable.
- The review process can be informal but must be documented.

### Resource Constraints
- Accept minimal but clear evidence (e.g., a one-page checklist or email).
- Do not require formal meeting minutes or complex documentation for micro-businesses.

### Industry Context
- For regulated sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance), expect more formal review processes.
- For non-regulated, small businesses, informal but documented reviews are sufficient.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- IRP exists but is never reviewed or updated.
- Reviews are claimed but not documented.
- Reviews are performed ad hoc, not annually.

### Documentation Issues
- Missing or undated evidence.
- Evidence not clearly linked to the IRP review.
- Only the IRP document is provided, with no indication of review.

### False Positives
- IRP document has a recent date but no evidence of actual review.
- “We always keep it up to date” without proof.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence the IRP was reviewed within the last 12 months?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is the evidence dated and clearly linked to the IRP review?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance – request clarification or additional evidence.

3. **Is the review process described and appropriate for the organization’s size?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance – request more detail.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If the review is just outside the 12-month window, seek guidance on proportionality.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must provide clear, dated evidence that their incident response plan was reviewed within the last 12 months, with documentation appropriate to their size and resources. Lack of evidence, outdated reviews, or superficial claims without proof should result in a FAIL or request for further clarification.
