# Evaluation Prompt for A.1.4e
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.1.4e

            ## Provision ID
            A.1.4e

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must conduct cybersecurity awareness initiatives for employees at least once per year. These initiatives should ensure that employees are equipped with the knowledge to act as the first line of defence against cyber threats. The provision also expects organizations to verify that employees have understood the training content, typically through a quiz or other knowledge assessment.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all employees are aware of basic cybersecurity threats and safe practices.
- Reduce risk of human error leading to security incidents.
- Foster a security-conscious culture within the organization.

**Context & Importance:**  
Human error is a leading cause of security breaches. Regular, effective awareness training helps employees recognize and respond appropriately to phishing, malware, and other common attacks. Annual refreshers are necessary to keep pace with evolving threats and to reinforce good habits.

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- Organization conducts cybersecurity awareness training for all employees at least once every 12 months.
- There is a mechanism to test or verify that employees have understood the training (e.g., quiz, survey, or practical exercise).
- Evidence (e.g., training records, quiz results, attendance logs) supports the claims.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No cybersecurity awareness training is conducted, or training is conducted less frequently than annually.
- No method to verify employee understanding (no quiz, test, or equivalent).
- No supporting evidence provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.

### **Partial Compliance**
- Training is conducted, but not for all employees or not within the last 12 months.
- Some form of knowledge check exists, but is informal or inconsistently applied.
- Evidence is incomplete or only partially supports the claims.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Training schedules, calendars, or communications showing annual training.
- Attendance records or sign-in sheets.
- Copies or screenshots of quizzes, surveys, or knowledge checks.
- Summary of quiz results or completion rates.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence should be dated and clearly linked to the last 12 months.
- Should cover all employees or provide a reasonable explanation for any exclusions.
- Quiz or knowledge check should be relevant to cybersecurity topics.

### **Red Flags**
- Evidence is undated, generic, or reused from previous years.
- Only policy documents provided, with no proof of actual training or testing.
- Evidence covers only a subset of employees without justification.
- Quiz is unrelated to cybersecurity or is a token effort (e.g., one irrelevant question).

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **Q1: How do you test that trainees walk away with the required knowledge? Is there a quiz conducted?**

**What to Look For:**
- Description of a quiz, survey, or other assessment method.
- Evidence of quiz content and results.

**Acceptable Responses:**
- "After each training session, employees complete a 10-question online quiz. Results are tracked by HR."
- "We use a phishing simulation to test awareness, and results are reviewed annually."

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- "We assume employees understand the material."
- "No quiz is conducted."
- "We just send out an email with tips."

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "Can you provide a sample of the quiz or assessment?"
- "How are results tracked and acted upon?"

---

### **Q2: How often do you conduct cybersecurity awareness trainings?**

**What to Look For:**
- Clear statement that training is conducted at least annually.
- Evidence of recent training (within the last 12 months).

**Acceptable Responses:**
- "Training is conducted every October for all staff."
- "We hold annual cybersecurity awareness sessions, last held in March 2024."

**Unacceptable Responses:**
- "We did training once, a few years ago."
- "Only new hires receive training."
- "We plan to do training in the future."

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "Can you provide the training schedule or attendance records?"
- "When was the last training conducted?"

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal group training or a simple quiz is acceptable, provided it is documented and covers all staff.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Free or low-cost online training modules are acceptable.
- Quizzes can be simple (e.g., 5â€“10 questions), as long as they are relevant and administered to all.

### **Industry Context**
- If the organization has high staff turnover, ensure all new hires receive training within a reasonable period (e.g., within 1 month of joining).
- For sectors with regulatory requirements, ensure training meets both Cyber Essentials and sector-specific standards.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Training is conducted but not documented.
- Only a subset of employees (e.g., IT staff) receive training.
- No knowledge check or assessment is performed.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Evidence is outdated or not linked to the current year.
- No proof of quiz or assessment results.

### **False Positives**
- Organization claims to conduct training but provides only a policy or plan, not proof of execution.
- Quiz is generic or unrelated to cybersecurity.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**

1. **Was cybersecurity awareness training conducted for all employees within the last 12 months?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

2. **Was employee understanding tested (e.g., quiz, assessment)?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Proceed

3. **Is there credible, dated evidence of both training and testing?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards for frequency, coverage, and evidence quality across all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and resources.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS this provision, the organization must show that all employees receive cybersecurity awareness training at least annually, and that their understanding is tested (e.g., via a quiz), with credible evidence to support these claims. Partial or inadequate responses should be followed up, and clear failures should be documented. Always consider the organization's size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement of annual, tested awareness training for all staff.
