# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.7.4c  
**Update: Software updates – Update software on devices and systems**  
**Provision Requirement:** The organisation should consider enabling automatic updates for critical operating system and application patches where feasible so that they can receive the latest updates.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must enable automatic updates for critical operating system and application patches wherever it is technically and operationally feasible. This ensures that devices and systems receive the latest security updates promptly, reducing the window of vulnerability to known threats.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities by ensuring timely patching.
- Reduce reliance on manual update processes, which are prone to human error or neglect.
- Ensure critical systems are protected against common exploits targeting outdated software.

**Context and Importance:**  
Automatic updates are a foundational defense against cyberattacks exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities. For resource-constrained organizations, automating this process is a practical way to maintain a secure baseline without requiring constant manual intervention.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Automatic updates are enabled for all critical operating systems and major applications where the feature is available and does not disrupt business operations.
- The organization demonstrates awareness of which systems/applications support automatic updates and has enabled the feature wherever feasible.
- If automatic updates are not enabled for certain systems, the organization provides a reasonable, documented justification (e.g., legacy system incompatibility, critical business application conflicts) and describes alternative update processes.

### FAIL Criteria
- Automatic updates are not enabled for critical systems/applications where it is feasible to do so, with no valid justification.
- The organization is unaware of the update settings or has not reviewed/update policies.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence contradicts the self-assessment response.

### Partial Compliance
- Automatic updates are enabled on some, but not all, critical systems/applications, with incomplete or unclear justification for exceptions.
- The organization is in the process of enabling automatic updates but has not completed implementation.
- The organization relies solely on manual updates without strong justification or compensating controls.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of update settings showing automatic updates enabled on representative devices/systems.
- Policy documents or procedures referencing automatic update requirements.
- Inventory lists indicating which systems have automatic updates enabled.
- Exception logs or memos explaining why automatic updates are not enabled on specific systems.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).
- Screenshots should clearly show device/system names and update settings.
- Documentation should be specific to the organization and not generic templates.
- Justifications for exceptions must be credible and relevant.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to the organization’s environment.
- Screenshots are cropped or edited to obscure key details.
- No evidence provided for claimed exceptions.
- Policies exist but are not implemented in practice.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Confirmation that automatic updates are enabled for all critical operating systems and applications where possible.
- Clear identification of any exceptions, with valid business or technical reasons.
- Evidence that settings have been reviewed and applied across the organization.

### Acceptable Responses
- “Automatic updates are enabled on all Windows and Mac computers, as well as Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader. For our legacy accounting software, automatic updates are not available; we apply updates manually monthly and have documented this process.”
- Screenshot of Windows Update settings showing “Automatic Updates: On” for multiple devices.
- Policy excerpt: “All staff laptops must have automatic updates enabled for OS and core applications.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We update our systems when we remember.”
- “Automatic updates are not enabled because it’s too disruptive,” with no further explanation or compensating controls.
- No evidence provided, or evidence only covers a single device when multiple are in use.

### Follow-up Questions
- Which systems/applications do not support automatic updates, and how are they updated?
- How often are manual updates performed for exceptions?
- Can you provide screenshots or logs from a sample of devices?
- How do you ensure new devices are configured with automatic updates enabled?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), spot-checking a sample of devices may suffice.
- For micro-businesses, a simple written policy and a few screenshots may be adequate.

### Resource Constraints
- If certain legacy systems cannot support automatic updates, a documented manual update process is acceptable if performed regularly (e.g., monthly).
- Reasonable effort means enabling automatic updates where the feature is available and does not cause operational issues.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with specialized software (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing) may have legitimate exceptions; ensure these are documented and alternative update processes are in place.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming updates are enabled by default without verification.
- Overlooking third-party applications that support automatic updates.
- Failing to document exceptions or manual update processes.

### Documentation Issues
- Providing only policy documents without evidence of implementation.
- Screenshots from a single device when multiple device types are in use.

### False Positives
- Responses that claim “all systems are updated automatically” without supporting evidence.
- Policies that require automatic updates but are not enforced in practice.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are automatic updates enabled for all critical OS/applications where feasible?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to evidence check.
   - **No:** Is there a valid, documented justification and compensating controls?
     - **Yes:** Partial compliance; assess adequacy of compensating controls.
     - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is sufficient, credible evidence provided?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** FAIL or request additional evidence.

3. **Are exceptions reasonable and documented?**
   - **Yes:** PASS or Partial (if compensating controls are adequate).
   - **No:** FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If exceptions are numerous or poorly justified, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If evidence is ambiguous or potentially fabricated, request additional evidence or clarification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and justification across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that automatic updates are enabled for all critical systems where possible, with documented exceptions and compensating controls for any gaps. Responses must be specific, supported by credible evidence, and proportionate to the organization’s size and resources. Inconsistent, vague, or unsupported claims should result in a FAIL or request for further clarification.
