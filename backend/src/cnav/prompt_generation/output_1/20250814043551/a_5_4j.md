# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4j  
**Clause: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision: Account reviews should be carried out at least quarterly or whenever there are changes to the account list, e.g., during onboarding and offboarding processes or organisation restructuring.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must review user accounts at least every three months (quarterly) and additionally whenever there are significant changes to personnel or organizational structure (e.g., onboarding, offboarding, restructuring). The goal is to ensure only authorized users have access to systems and data, and that access is revoked promptly when no longer needed.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access by removing or updating accounts as roles change.
- Minimize risk from orphaned, unused, or excessive privilege accounts.
- Ensure access rights reflect current organizational needs.

**Context & Importance:**  
Regular account reviews are a fundamental control to prevent data breaches and insider threats. They are especially critical for small organizations where informal processes may lead to oversight. This provision ensures that access is actively managed, not just set-and-forget.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- Organization states that account reviews are conducted **at least quarterly** (every 3 months).
- Organization also reviews accounts **during onboarding/offboarding** or after organizational changes.
- There is evidence of a **repeatable process** (e.g., checklist, calendar reminders, or documented procedure).
- If evidence is provided, it shows **recent reviews** (within the last quarter).

### FAIL Criteria
- Reviews are conducted **less frequently than quarterly** (e.g., annually, ad hoc, or only when issues arise).
- No mention of reviews during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes.
- No process or evidence of reviews.
- Responses indicate reviews are “planned” but not yet implemented.

### Partial Compliance
- Reviews are conducted, but **not as frequently as required** (e.g., semi-annually).
- Reviews are only done during onboarding/offboarding, not on a regular schedule.
- Process exists but is **not consistently followed** (e.g., missed recent quarters).
- Evidence is incomplete or outdated (e.g., last review was over 3 months ago).

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Account review logs or checklists (manual or digital).
- Calendar invites/reminders for scheduled reviews.
- Email records or meeting notes referencing account reviews.
- Written procedures or policies describing the review process.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last quarter).
- Should show **who conducted the review**, **when**, and **what was checked**.
- Evidence should be **specific** (not generic statements or templates).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated or not tied to actual reviews.
- Evidence is a policy only, with no proof of execution.
- Evidence is outdated (older than 3 months).
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical checklists for multiple periods).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question: **How often are account reviews carried out?**

#### What to Look For
- Clear statement of review frequency (e.g., “quarterly” or “every 3 months”).
- Mention of reviews during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes.
- Description of the process (who, how, what is reviewed).
- Supporting evidence as described above.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “We conduct account reviews every quarter and whenever staff join, leave, or change roles. We use a checklist and keep records in our shared drive.”
- “Account reviews are scheduled every 3 months. We also review accounts during onboarding and offboarding. See attached review logs for the last two quarters.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We review accounts once a year.”
- “We review accounts when we remember or when someone leaves.”
- “We plan to start quarterly reviews soon.”
- “We have a policy, but no records of actual reviews.”

#### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide evidence of your most recent account review?”
- “How do you ensure reviews happen on schedule?”
- “Who is responsible for conducting the reviews?”
- “What steps are taken if an account is found to be unnecessary?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or checklist is acceptable.
- The process can be informal but must be **documented and repeatable**.

### Resource Constraints
- Automated tools are not required; manual reviews are acceptable.
- Reasonable effort means at least a basic record of reviews and actions taken.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with high staff turnover or sensitive data may need more frequent or detailed reviews.
- For sectors with regulatory requirements, ensure alignment with those standards.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Confusing onboarding/offboarding with regular reviews (must do both).
- Reviews are claimed but not documented.
- Reviews are performed only after incidents, not proactively.

### Documentation Issues
- Only policies provided, no proof of execution.
- Evidence is outdated or incomplete.
- No clear assignment of responsibility.

### False Positives
- Vague statements (“We review regularly”) without specifics or evidence.
- Templates or checklists with no dates or signatures.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence of account reviews at least quarterly?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Are reviews also conducted during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification).

3. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and credible?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on severity).

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or inconsistent, request additional documentation.
- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes frequency requirements or provides conflicting information.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for size and reasonable resource constraints.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate (with credible evidence) that account reviews are conducted at least quarterly and during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes. The process should be documented, repeatable, and recent. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept ad hoc or undocumented practices.
