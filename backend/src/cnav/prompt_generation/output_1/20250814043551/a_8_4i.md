            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4i  
**Clause:** Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline  
**Provision Requirement:** Frequent backups such as daily or weekly backups should be stored online to facilitate quick recovery, e.g., cloud backup storage.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must perform frequent (at least weekly, ideally daily) backups of essential data and ensure that these backups are stored online (e.g., in cloud storage or on a networked backup server) to enable rapid restoration in case of data loss or incident.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure business continuity by enabling quick recovery from data loss, ransomware, or system failure.
- Minimize downtime and data loss by having recent, accessible backups.
- Reduce the impact of cyber incidents by maintaining up-to-date, restorable copies of essential data.

**Context & Importance:**  
Storing frequent backups online (in addition to any offline backups) is critical for rapid recovery. Offline backups protect against ransomware, but online backups allow for quick restoration, which is vital for operational resilience, especially for organizations with limited IT resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization performs backups of essential data at least weekly (preferably daily).
- Backups are stored online (e.g., cloud storage, network-attached storage, or other accessible online platforms).
- The backup process is documented and evidence of recent backups is available.
- The organization can describe or demonstrate how quick recovery would be performed using these online backups.

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence of frequent (at least weekly) backups.
- Backups are only stored offline (e.g., on USB drives or external hard disks not connected to the network/cloud).
- No online backup solution is in place.
- The organization cannot provide evidence or a credible description of online backup and recovery processes.

### Partial Compliance
- Backups are performed, but less frequently than weekly.
- Online backups exist, but only for a subset of essential data.
- The process is ad-hoc or undocumented.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of backup software dashboards showing recent backup dates and storage locations.
- Backup logs or reports indicating frequency and destination (e.g., cloud provider, network share).
- Written procedures or policies describing the backup schedule and storage method.
- Contracts or invoices from cloud backup providers (if applicable).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last month for daily/weekly backups).
- Documentation should clearly indicate that backups are stored online and are accessible for quick recovery.
- Screenshots/logs should show backup dates, frequency, and storage location.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated (older than one month).
- Only generic statements are provided without supporting documentation.
- Evidence does not specify storage location or frequency.
- Screenshots or logs are incomplete, cropped, or appear fabricated.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question: **Are frequent backups stored online for quick recovery?**

#### What to Look For
- Clear statement that backups are performed at least weekly (preferably daily).
- Confirmation that backups are stored online (cloud, network-attached storage, etc.).
- Evidence that demonstrates both the frequency and the online nature of the backups.
- Description of how quick recovery would be performed using these backups.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We perform daily backups of our essential data to [cloud provider] and can restore files within hours. Attached are screenshots of our backup dashboard showing daily backups to the cloud."
- "Weekly backups are automatically saved to our network-attached storage, accessible by IT for quick restoration. See attached backup logs from the past four weeks."
- "Our backup policy mandates daily backups to [cloud service], and here is our backup schedule and recent backup report."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We back up data to external hard drives once a month." (Offline only, not frequent enough)
- "We have a backup process but do not use any online storage." (No online backup)
- "We plan to implement online backups in the future." (Not currently implemented)
- "No evidence provided."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide a screenshot or log showing the most recent online backup?"
- "What data is included in your online backups?"
- "How quickly can you restore data from your online backup?"
- "Is the backup process automated or manual?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple cloud backup solution (e.g., Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox) is acceptable if it is used regularly and covers essential data.
- Manual backups are acceptable if performed at least weekly and stored online.

### Resource Constraints
- The solution should be proportionate: low-cost or free cloud services are acceptable for small organizations.
- Documentation can be simple (e.g., a backup schedule in a spreadsheet), but must be current and accurate.

### Industry Context
- Organizations handling sensitive or regulated data may require more robust solutions, but for most Cyber Essentials applicants, basic cloud or networked backups are sufficient.
- Sector-specific data (e.g., medical, financial) may require additional evidence of compliance with industry regulations.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Backups are performed but only stored offline.
- Backups are infrequent (monthly or ad-hoc).
- Only some essential data is backed up online.
- No evidence of recent backups.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of backup logs or schedules.
- Evidence does not specify storage location.
- Outdated or generic documentation.

### False Positives
- Claiming to use cloud storage but only for file sharing, not for systematic backups.
- Screenshots showing backup software but no indication of online storage or frequency.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are backups performed at least weekly?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

2. **Are backups stored online (cloud or networked storage)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

3. **Is there recent, credible evidence of online backups?**
   - If NO → FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)
   - If YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request clarification or additional documentation.
- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide evidence, escalate to a senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and resources.
- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate that frequent (at least weekly) backups of essential data are stored online and can be quickly restored, with recent and credible evidence provided. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept lack of online backups or infrequent backup schedules. Always require evidence that is recent, specific, and clearly shows compliance with the provision.
