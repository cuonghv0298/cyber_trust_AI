---

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4d  
**Clause:** Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline  
**Provision:** The backup process should be automated where feasible.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must implement automated backup processes for essential data wherever it is practical to do so, rather than relying solely on manual backups. This means using built-in or third-party tools to schedule and perform regular backups with minimal human intervention, especially for critical business data.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure essential data is consistently and reliably backed up.
- Reduce the risk of human error or omission in backup routines.
- Increase the likelihood of successful data recovery after incidents (e.g., ransomware, accidental deletion).

**Context & Importance:**  
Manual backups are prone to being forgotten, skipped, or performed incorrectly. Automation increases reliability and ensures that backups occur as scheduled, which is vital for business continuity and resilience against cyber threats.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has implemented automated backup processes for all essential data where automation is technically and operationally feasible.
- Automation is demonstrated for key systems (e.g., servers, cloud storage, critical workstations).
- Manual backups are only used where automation is genuinely not feasible (e.g., for certain legacy systems or highly mobile devices), and this is clearly justified.

### FAIL Criteria
- Backups are performed manually when automation is feasible but not implemented.
- No evidence of automation for any essential data, with no valid justification.
- The organization is unaware of automation options or has not considered them.

### Partial Compliance
- Some essential data is backed up automatically, but other critical data is still backed up manually without clear justification.
- The organization is in the process of implementing automation but has not yet completed it.
- Automation is claimed but not consistently applied or only covers a small subset of essential data.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of backup software scheduling/configuration screens.
- Backup logs showing automated execution times/dates.
- Policy documents or SOPs describing automated backup routines.
- Vendor documentation or system settings indicating scheduled backups.
- Exception documentation for systems where automation is not feasible.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).
- Evidence must clearly show automation (e.g., scheduled tasks, recurring jobs).
- Documentation should match the organization’s described backup scope and frequency.

### Red Flags
- Vague statements without supporting evidence (“We do backups regularly”).
- Evidence of only ad-hoc/manual backups (e.g., screenshots of manual file copies).
- Outdated or irrelevant screenshots/logs.
- No mention of exceptions or rationale for manual processes.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear description of which data is backed up and how automation is achieved.
- Identification of backup tools or built-in OS features used for automation.
- Evidence that scheduled backups are running as intended.
- Justification for any manual backup processes.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We use [backup software/cloud service] to automatically back up our server data every night. See attached screenshot of the scheduled backup job and recent backup logs.”
- “All staff laptops are configured to back up Documents folders to OneDrive automatically. Manual backups are only done for [legacy system], which cannot be automated (see attached justification).”
- “Our accounting system is backed up daily using Windows Task Scheduler. See attached configuration and log files.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We ask staff to back up their files every week.” (Manual, no automation)
- “We do backups when we remember.” (No process, no automation)
- “We plan to automate backups in the future.” (Not yet implemented)
- “We use USB drives for backups.” (Unless automation is demonstrated, e.g., scheduled imaging)

### Follow-up Questions
- Which backup tools or features are used for automation?
- Can you provide recent logs or screenshots showing scheduled backups?
- For any manual backups, why is automation not feasible?
- How do you verify that automated backups are successful?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), automation may be as simple as enabling built-in OS/cloud backup features (e.g., Windows File History, macOS Time Machine, Google Drive/OneDrive sync).
- Manual backups may be acceptable for isolated, low-risk systems if justified, but automation should be the default for essential data.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or low-cost automation tools are acceptable (e.g., built-in OS features, free backup utilities).
- “Reasonable effort” means using available features rather than purchasing enterprise solutions.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements; however, Cyber Essentials baseline applies to all.
- For organizations with highly mobile staff, cloud-based automated backups may be more practical.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) is a backup without versioning or offline copy.
- Relying on staff to remember to back up data.
- Not automating backups for servers or shared drives.

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots showing only manual backup processes.
- Logs that do not indicate scheduled/automated activity.
- Lack of evidence for claimed automation.

### False Positives
- Describing a process as “automatic” when it is actually manual.
- Confusing file synchronization with true backup (no versioning, no offline copy).

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence of automated backup for all essential data where feasible?**
   - **Yes:** PASS
   - **No:** Go to 2

2. **Are manual backups used only where automation is not feasible, with clear justification?**
   - **Yes:** PARTIAL (request further evidence/clarification)
   - **No:** FAIL

3. **Is there any evidence of automation in place?**
   - **Yes, but incomplete:** PARTIAL (request improvement plan)
   - **No:** FAIL

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If justification for manual backups is weak or unsupported, request additional evidence or clarification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for what constitutes “automation” across all organizations.
- Ensure that exceptions for manual backups are consistently justified and documented.
- Document all assessment decisions and rationale for transparency.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that automated backup processes are in place for all essential data where feasible. Manual backups should be the exception, not the rule, and must be justified. Responses lacking evidence, relying on manual processes without justification, or describing future plans rather than current practice should result in a FAIL. Use the decision tree and practical considerations to ensure fair and consistent assessments.
