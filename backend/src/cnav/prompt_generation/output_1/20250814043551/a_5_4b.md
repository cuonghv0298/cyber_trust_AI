# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4b  
**Secure/Protect: Access Control – Account Inventory List Completeness**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must maintain an up-to-date account inventory list that includes all user, administrator, third-party, and service accounts. For each account, the inventory must record at least the following details:
- Name (of the account holder or service)
- Username
- Department
- Role/account type (e.g., user, admin, service, third-party)
- Date of access created
- Last logon date

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all accounts are tracked and managed to prevent unauthorized access.
- Enable timely identification and removal of unused or unnecessary accounts.
- Support accountability and traceability for access to organizational data and services.

**Context and Importance:**  
Untracked or unmanaged accounts are a common vector for cyberattacks. Maintaining a complete and current account inventory is a foundational control to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, privilege misuse, and account compromise, especially in resource-constrained environments.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides an account inventory list (e.g., spreadsheet, export from directory, or equivalent) that **explicitly includes all six required fields** for each account.
- The list covers **all relevant account types**: user, administrator, third-party, and service accounts.
- The inventory is **current** (updated within the last 3 months or as per organization policy).
- Evidence demonstrates that the inventory is actively maintained (not a one-off or outdated snapshot).

### FAIL Criteria
- The inventory list is missing **one or more required fields** for any account type.
- The list **excludes** any account type (e.g., only user accounts, omitting service or third-party accounts).
- The inventory is **outdated** (not updated within a reasonable timeframe).
- No evidence of an account inventory is provided, or the evidence is clearly fabricated or generic.

### Partial Compliance
- The inventory includes most but not all required fields (e.g., missing "last logon date" for some accounts).
- Some account types are present, but others are missing or not clearly identified.
- The inventory is present but not clearly up-to-date.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Account inventory list (spreadsheet, system export, or documented table).
- Screenshots of account management systems showing required fields.
- Policy or procedure documents describing how the inventory is maintained (optional but supportive).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be **specific to the organization** (not a template or example).
- The list must be **legible, complete, and cover all required fields**.
- The inventory should be **recent** (dated or showing recent logon activity).

### Red Flags
- Inventory is a generic template with no real data.
- Fields are present as column headers but not populated.
- List only includes user accounts, omitting admins, third-party, or service accounts.
- Evidence is undated or clearly outdated.
- Inconsistent or obviously fabricated data (e.g., all "last logon dates" are identical or blank).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- **Presence of all six required fields** for each account.
- **Coverage of all account types** (user, admin, third-party, service).
- **Evidence of regular updates** (recent "last logon date", recent "date of access created").
- **Organization-specific data** (not a template).

### Acceptable Responses
- "We maintain an Excel spreadsheet listing all accounts with columns for name, username, department, role/account type, date of access created, and last logon date. Attached is a redacted sample showing all fields populated for user, admin, and service accounts."
- "Our Active Directory export includes all required fields. See attached screenshot and export file."
- "We review and update the account inventory monthly. Here is the latest version from last month."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We have a list of users, but it does not include last logon date or account creation date."
- "We only track user accounts, not service or third-party accounts."
- "We do not keep an account inventory."
- "Here is a template we plan to use" (with no actual data).

### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide a recent version of the account inventory with all required fields populated?"
- "How do you ensure service and third-party accounts are included in your inventory?"
- "When was the inventory last updated?"
- "How do you obtain the 'last logon date' for each account?"

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or table is acceptable, as long as all required fields and account types are covered.
- For organizations with no third-party or service accounts, a statement confirming this is acceptable, but the inventory must still show all user/admin accounts.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual tracking is acceptable if automated tools are not available, provided the inventory is complete and up-to-date.
- Reasonable effort means the organization should be able to produce the inventory within a few days of request.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have more complex account structures; ensure all relevant account types are considered.
- For organizations using cloud services, ensure cloud-based accounts are included.

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Missing service or third-party accounts.
- Missing "last logon date" or "date of access created".
- Inventory not updated regularly.

### Documentation Issues
- Providing only a template or policy, not the actual inventory.
- Redacted samples that remove all meaningful data.
- Evidence that is not organization-specific.

### False Positives
- Inventory appears complete but is outdated.
- All fields present as headers but not populated.
- Inventory only covers a subset of accounts.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is an account inventory provided?**
   - No → **FAIL**
   - Yes → Next step

2. **Does the inventory include all six required fields for each account?**
   - No → **FAIL**
   - Yes → Next step

3. **Are all account types (user, admin, third-party, service) included or explicitly accounted for?**
   - No → **FAIL**
   - Yes → Next step

4. **Is the inventory current (updated within last 3 months or as per policy)?**
   - No → **FAIL**
   - Yes → **PASS**

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or partially compliant, request clarification or additional evidence.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization cannot provide a satisfactory inventory or if there are concerns about evidence authenticity.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should ensure the organization provides a current, complete, and organization-specific account inventory covering all required fields and account types. Evidence must be credible and demonstrate active management of accounts. Partial or template-only responses are not sufficient. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but all must meet the baseline requirements for this provision.
