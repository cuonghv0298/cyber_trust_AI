# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4b  
**Clause**: Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection  
**Provision**: Virus and malware scans shall be carried out to detect possible cyberattacks. Where feasible, scans should always be automated and remain active to provide constant protection.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must have measures in place to detect and prevent malicious software (malware, viruses, ransomware, etc.) on all IT assets. This includes running regular virus/malware scans, ideally automated and with real-time protection enabled, to provide ongoing defense against cyber threats.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Early detection and removal of malware before it can cause harm  
- Continuous protection through automated, active scanning  
- Minimizing risk of infection and spread within the organization

**Context & Importance:**  
Malware is a leading cause of data breaches and operational disruption. Automated, active scanning is a fundamental, low-effort, high-impact control that prevents common attacks. For resource-constrained organizations, using built-in or reputable free anti-malware solutions is acceptable if properly configured and maintained.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has anti-malware software installed on all relevant devices (servers, desktops, laptops, and, where feasible, mobile devices).
- Virus/malware scans are performed regularly (at least weekly), and real-time/active protection is enabled where possible.
- Scans are automated (scheduled or real-time) rather than solely manual.
- The solution is up-to-date and supported (not end-of-life).
- The organization can provide evidence of scans being performed (e.g., logs, screenshots, settings).

### FAIL Criteria
- No anti-malware solution is in place, or only some devices are protected.
- Scans are performed only manually and infrequently (less than monthly).
- Real-time/active protection is not enabled and no justification is provided.
- The anti-malware solution is outdated, unsupported, or expired.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.

### Partial Compliance
- Anti-malware is installed but only on some devices (e.g., only on desktops, not laptops).
- Scans are performed but not automated or not frequent enough.
- Real-time protection is not enabled due to technical constraints, but compensating controls are described.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of anti-malware software installed and running on devices
- Configuration screenshots showing scheduled scans and real-time protection enabled
- Scan logs or reports showing recent scan activity
- Asset inventory showing coverage of anti-malware deployment

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months)
- Screenshots/logs must clearly show device names, dates, and status
- Evidence must be consistent with the organization's asset inventory

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic (e.g., stock images, vendor marketing screenshots)
- Evidence is outdated or shows last scan was months ago
- Evidence only covers a subset of devices without explanation
- No evidence provided, or evidence is unverifiable

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question: "Any anti-malware solutions in place?"

#### What to Look For
- Clear identification of anti-malware solution(s) used (e.g., Windows Defender, Avast, Sophos)
- Confirmation that the solution is installed on all relevant devices
- Description of scan frequency and whether scans are automated/real-time
- Supporting evidence as described above

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We use Windows Defender on all company laptops and desktops. Real-time protection is enabled, and weekly scans are scheduled automatically. See attached screenshots of settings and recent scan logs."
- "All devices have Avast Free Antivirus installed with real-time protection. Monthly scan reports are attached."
- "We use Sophos Endpoint Protection, managed centrally. All endpoints are covered, and daily scans are scheduled. See management console screenshot."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We ask staff to run scans when they remember."
- "Only our main office PC has antivirus; laptops do not."
- "We used to have antivirus, but it expired."
- "No evidence provided."

#### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide screenshots or logs showing recent scans on all devices?"
- "Is real-time protection enabled? If not, why?"
- "How do you ensure new devices are protected?"
- "How often are scans performed, and are they automated?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), built-in solutions (e.g., Windows Defender) are acceptable if enabled and configured correctly.
- For organizations with only a few devices, manual checks are acceptable if documented and performed at least weekly.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or built-in anti-malware solutions are acceptable if kept up-to-date and properly configured.
- Manual scans may be accepted if automation is not feasible, but frequency must be at least weekly and documented.

### Industry Context
- For organizations with high mobile device usage, mobile anti-malware is encouraged but not strictly required unless devices handle sensitive data.
- For organizations with legacy systems, compensating controls must be described if anti-malware cannot be installed.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only some devices are protected (e.g., desktops but not laptops or remote devices)
- Scans are not automated or are performed infrequently
- Real-time protection is disabled without justification

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is missing, outdated, or not device-specific
- Screenshots do not show relevant details (e.g., scan dates, device names)

### False Positives
- Responses claim compliance but provide no supporting evidence
- Evidence is generic or appears copied from the internet

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is anti-malware installed on all relevant devices?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

2. **Are scans automated and/or is real-time protection enabled?**
   - If NO, and only manual scans are performed less than weekly → FAIL
   - If YES, or manual scans are at least weekly and documented → proceed

3. **Is the anti-malware solution up-to-date and supported?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

4. **Is sufficient, recent, and device-specific evidence provided?**
   - If NO → Partial/FAIL (request more evidence)
   - If YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request clarification or additional evidence.
- If the organization claims technical constraints, escalate for senior auditor review to assess compensating controls.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.
- Document rationale for all decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent evidence that anti-malware solutions are installed, active, and scanning all relevant devices automatically or at least weekly. Responses lacking evidence, coverage, or automation should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the requirement for basic, active malware protection.
