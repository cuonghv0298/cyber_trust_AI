# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4i  
**Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision Requirement:** Physical access control shall be enforced to allow only authorised employees/contractors to access the organisation’s IT assets and/or environment, e.g., use of cable lock to lock the workstations and card access door lock to authenticate and authorise entry.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must implement and enforce physical access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel (employees or contractors) can physically access IT assets (e.g., servers, workstations, networking equipment) and the environments where these assets are located (e.g., server rooms, offices). Examples include card-access door locks, cable locks for workstations, locked cabinets, or other physical barriers.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized physical access to IT assets, reducing risk of theft, tampering, or data compromise.
- Ensure accountability for physical access to sensitive areas or devices.
- Deter opportunistic or malicious physical attacks.

**Context/Importance:**  
Physical access is a foundational security control. Even with strong digital protections, physical access can allow attackers to bypass technical controls. This is especially critical for small organizations that may not have dedicated security staff or advanced monitoring.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has implemented at least one effective physical access control for all areas where IT assets are located.
- Only authorized personnel (employees/contractors) can access these areas/assets.
- Controls are appropriate for the environment (e.g., card access for office doors, cable locks for laptops, locked cabinets for networking equipment).
- The organization can describe how access is granted, revoked, and monitored.
- Evidence (if provided) supports the existence and use of these controls.

### FAIL Criteria
- No physical access controls are in place for IT assets or environments.
- Access is unrestricted or open to the public/unauthorized individuals.
- Controls are described but not enforced (e.g., “we have a lock, but it’s never used”).
- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or contradicts the self-assessment.

### Partial Compliance
- Some, but not all, IT assets/environments are protected.
- Controls exist but are inconsistently applied or poorly maintained.
- The organization relies solely on informal or ad-hoc measures (e.g., “staff are told not to let strangers in”).
- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine adequacy.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Photos of physical controls (e.g., card readers, cable locks, locked doors/cabinets).
- Access control policies or procedures.
- Access logs or records (if available).
- Asset inventory showing location and protection measures.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Photos should clearly show the control in use.
- Policies/procedures should be specific to physical access, not generic.
- Evidence should match the description in the self-assessment.

### Red Flags
- Stock or internet photos instead of actual site photos.
- Outdated or generic policies with no mention of physical controls.
- Descriptions of controls that are not supported by evidence.
- Evidence that shows controls are present but not used (e.g., unlocked doors in photos).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear description of physical access controls in place for all IT assets/environments.
- Identification of who is authorized and how authorization is managed.
- Evidence that controls are implemented and used in practice.

### Acceptable Responses
- “All office doors are secured with card-access locks. Only employees and authorized contractors have cards. Server room is locked and only IT staff have keys. Laptops are secured with cable locks when not in use. See attached photos of card readers and cable locks.”
- “Workstations are kept in a locked office. Only staff have keys. Network equipment is stored in a locked cabinet. Policy attached.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We trust our staff not to let strangers in.”
- “The office is usually locked, but sometimes left open for deliveries.”
- “No physical controls, but we have antivirus software.”
- “We plan to install locks next year.”

### Follow-up Questions
- Which areas/assets are protected by physical access controls?
- How is access granted and revoked for employees/contractors?
- Are there any IT assets not protected by physical controls? Why?
- Can you provide photos or documentation of the controls in use?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a single locked office door may suffice if all IT assets are inside and only staff have keys.
- Home-based businesses: evidence of locked home office or secure storage for business IT assets is acceptable.

### Resource Constraints
- Expensive solutions (e.g., biometric readers) are not required; basic locks, cable locks, or locked cabinets are sufficient if used consistently.
- Reasonable effort means using available, practical controls to restrict access.

### Industry Context
- Retail or public-facing businesses: back-office or IT storage areas must be physically secured, even if the front area is public.
- Co-working/shared spaces: organization must demonstrate how their assets are secured (e.g., locked drawers, portable device locks).

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming digital controls (passwords, firewalls) are sufficient without physical controls.
- Only securing some assets (e.g., server but not workstations).
- Relying on informal practices (“staff are vigilant”) instead of enforceable controls.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence or outdated photos/policies.
- Policies that mention physical security but do not specify actual controls in use.

### False Positives
- Descriptions of controls that are not actually implemented.
- Evidence of controls in place but not used (e.g., keys left in locks, doors propped open).

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are physical access controls implemented for all IT assets/environments?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Are controls enforced and only authorized personnel have access?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is there credible evidence supporting the implementation and use of controls?**
   - **No** → Partial/FAIL (request more evidence)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or missing, request additional information.
- If controls are only partially implemented, escalate to senior auditor for risk-based decision.
- If organization claims controls are “in progress,” mark as FAIL until implemented.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size or context.
- Document rationale for decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical, and enforced physical access controls protecting all IT assets/environments, supported by credible evidence. Responses must demonstrate that only authorized personnel can access these assets, with controls appropriate to the organization’s size and context. Incomplete, informal, or unsubstantiated responses should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.
