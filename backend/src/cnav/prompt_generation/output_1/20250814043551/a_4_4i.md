# Evaluation Prompt for A.4.4i
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.4.4i

            ## Provision ID
            A.4.4i

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must demonstrate that, where the certification scope includes mobile and/or IoT devices, firewalls are installed and enabled on employees’ mobile devices and configured/enabled on IoT devices wherever possible. This is a **recommended** (not strictly mandatory) control, but organizations are expected to show reasonable effort to implement it, or provide a justified explanation if not feasible.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce the risk of malware and unauthorized access on mobile and IoT devices.
- Prevent lateral movement of threats within the organization’s network.
- Establish a baseline of device-level protection, especially for devices that may operate outside the organization’s perimeter.

**Context & Importance:**  
Mobile and IoT devices are common entry points for cyber threats due to their mobility, diversity, and often limited built-in security. Enabling firewalls helps block malicious traffic and unauthorized connections, providing an essential layer of defense for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization clearly identifies whether mobile and/or IoT devices are in scope.
- For **mobile devices**:  
  - Firewalls are installed and enabled on all employee mobile devices, **or**  
  - If not, a reasonable explanation is provided (e.g., technical limitations, OS restrictions, or managed via MDM with equivalent protections).
- For **IoT devices**:  
  - Firewalls are configured and enabled where technically possible, **or**  
  - If not possible, a reasonable explanation is provided (e.g., device does not support firewall, alternative network segmentation is in place).
- The organization demonstrates awareness of the recommendation and has taken reasonable steps to comply or mitigate.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No mention of firewalls on mobile or IoT devices, despite such devices being in scope.
- Blanket statements such as “not applicable” without justification.
- No evidence of consideration or action regarding firewalls.
- Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., “all devices are protected” with no details).

### **Partial Compliance**
- Firewalls are enabled on some, but not all, devices, with partial justification.
- The organization is in the process of implementing firewalls, with a clear plan and timeline.
- The explanation for not enabling firewalls is vague or incomplete.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Device configuration screenshots showing firewall status (enabled/disabled).
- Mobile Device Management (MDM) policy documentation or screenshots.
- Network diagrams or inventory lists indicating IoT device firewall status.
- Written explanations for exceptions (e.g., device limitations, alternative controls).

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 6–12 months).
- Screenshots must clearly show device type, firewall status, and date/time if possible.
- Policy documents should be specific to mobile/IoT devices and reference firewall controls.

### **Red Flags**
- Generic policy statements with no device-specific evidence.
- Outdated screenshots or documents.
- Evidence that does not match the devices in scope.
- Copy-pasted or template responses with no organization-specific details.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Confirmation that mobile and/or IoT devices are in scope.
- Clear statement on whether firewalls are installed/enabled on these devices.
- If not enabled, a specific and reasonable explanation.
- Supporting evidence as described above.

### **Acceptable Responses**
- “All company-issued mobile phones have firewalls enabled via MDM. See attached screenshots from our MDM dashboard.”
- “Our IoT cameras do not support onboard firewalls, but they are isolated on a separate VLAN with firewall rules at the network level. See attached network diagram.”
- “We use iOS devices, which have built-in firewall features managed via Apple Business Manager. See attached policy.”

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “Not applicable” with no further explanation.
- “We assume all devices are protected.”
- “We don’t have firewalls on IoT devices” with no justification or alternative controls.
- Evidence that is generic, outdated, or unrelated to the devices in question.

### **Follow-up Questions**
- Can you provide screenshots or documentation showing firewall status on a sample of devices?
- If firewalls are not enabled, what alternative protections are in place?
- How do you ensure new devices are configured with firewalls upon deployment?
- Are there any devices for which enabling a firewall is not possible? Please specify.

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a sample of device screenshots or a simple written policy may suffice.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized MDM or inventory documentation.

### **Resource Constraints**
- If technical limitations prevent firewall installation, a reasonable explanation and evidence of alternative controls (e.g., network segmentation) is acceptable.
- “Reasonable effort” means at least considering the recommendation and documenting the decision process.

### **Industry Context**
- Some industries (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing) may use IoT devices with limited security features; alternative compensating controls should be described.
- For organizations with BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), clarify how firewall controls are enforced or recommended.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Failing to consider IoT devices as part of the scope.
- Assuming built-in OS protections are sufficient without verification.
- Not documenting exceptions or alternative controls.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Lack of device-specific evidence.
- Outdated or irrelevant screenshots.
- Policies that do not mention mobile or IoT devices.

### **False Positives**
- Statements of compliance without supporting evidence.
- Over-reliance on “default” device settings without confirmation.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Are mobile and/or IoT devices in scope?**
   - If no, mark as PASS (not applicable).
   - If yes, proceed.
2. **Are firewalls installed/enabled on these devices?**
   - If yes, and evidence is provided, PASS.
   - If no, is there a reasonable, documented explanation and/or alternative controls?  
     - If yes, PASS.
     - If no, FAIL.
3. **Is the evidence sufficient, recent, and device-specific?**
   - If yes, PASS.
   - If no, FAIL or request clarification.

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If the explanation for non-implementation is unclear or seems unreasonable, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent, escalate for further review.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards for evidence and justification across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or exception cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, device-specific evidence that firewalls are enabled on mobile and IoT devices where possible, or a reasonable explanation and alternative controls where not possible. Responses must be supported by recent, credible evidence and tailored to the organization’s actual device landscape. Where resource or technical constraints exist, these must be documented and justified. Consistency and proportionality should guide all assessment decisions.
