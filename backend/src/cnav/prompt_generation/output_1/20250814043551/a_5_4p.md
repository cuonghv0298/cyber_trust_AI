# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4p  
**Clause: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  
**Provision: Where feasible, trusted software to manage passphrases should be used to aide employee passphrase management.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations should, where feasible, use trusted software (e.g., password managers) to help employees manage their passphrases. This means providing employees with access to a reputable password management tool, or having a clear, organization-wide approach for secure passphrase storage and retrieval.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce the risk of weak, reused, or forgotten passwords.
- Prevent insecure storage of passwords (e.g., on paper, spreadsheets).
- Enable employees to use strong, unique passphrases for different accounts.

**Context & Importance:**  
Password-related breaches are among the most common cyber incidents. Small organizations often struggle with password complexity and management. This provision aims to ensure that, within reasonable means, organizations adopt tools or processes that help employees securely manage their credentials, thus reducing the likelihood of compromise due to poor password practices.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization uses a reputable, trusted password manager (cloud-based or on-premises) for employee passphrase management, **OR**
- The organization has a documented, secure process for managing passphrases that does not rely on insecure methods (e.g., passwords are not stored in plain text, spreadsheets, or written down), **AND**
- The solution is deployed to all relevant employees and is in active use.

### FAIL Criteria
- No password management software or secure process is in place.
- Employees are expected to remember all passwords or use insecure methods (e.g., writing passwords on paper, storing in unprotected files).
- The organization claims password management is "not feasible" without reasonable justification.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization is piloting a password manager but has not rolled it out to all staff.
- Only some employees have access to a password manager.
- The organization uses a password manager, but there is no evidence of actual use or employee awareness.
- The organization claims infeasibility but provides some mitigating controls (e.g., enforced strong password policies, MFA) – requires further investigation.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of password manager software in use (with sensitive info redacted).
- License or subscription records for password manager tools.
- Internal communications or training materials about password manager deployment.
- Policy documents referencing password management practices.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Evidence should demonstrate organization-wide adoption, not just IT/admin use.
- Documentation should be specific to the organization (not generic vendor brochures).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated or references tools no longer in use.
- Only policy documents are provided, with no proof of implementation.
- Evidence is limited to a single user or device.
- Screenshots or documents appear generic or copied from the internet.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear identification of the password manager or secure process in use.
- Evidence that employees have access and are instructed to use the tool.
- Confirmation that the tool is reputable (e.g., well-known vendors, not obscure freeware).
- If not feasible, a reasonable explanation (e.g., all accounts are managed via SSO with enforced MFA, or organization size is 1-2 people).

### Acceptable Responses
- "We use LastPass/1Password/Bitwarden for all staff. See attached screenshot of our admin dashboard and training email sent to employees."
- "All employees are required to use KeePass, and we provide installation instructions and support. See attached policy and screenshot."
- "Due to our small size (2 employees), all accounts are managed via Google Workspace SSO with enforced MFA. No additional password manager is needed."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "Employees are told to remember their passwords."
- "We keep passwords in a shared Excel file."
- "We do not use any password manager because it is too expensive," with no alternative controls.
- "We plan to implement a password manager in the future."

### Follow-up Questions
- How do you ensure all employees are using the password manager?
- What training or guidance is provided to staff?
- If not feasible, what alternative controls are in place to ensure strong, unique passphrases?
- Can you provide a recent example of how a new employee is onboarded with password management?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For micro-organizations (1-2 people), use of SSO with enforced MFA may be sufficient if all accounts are managed centrally.
- For small organizations, free or open-source password managers are acceptable if deployed and used properly.

### Resource Constraints
- Auditors should accept low-cost or free solutions if they are reputable and properly implemented.
- "Not feasible" is only acceptable with strong justification and compensating controls.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with regulatory requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter controls.
- Organizations with highly mobile or remote staff should show how password management is handled offsite.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Password manager only used by IT/admin, not all staff.
- Policy exists, but no evidence of actual use.
- Employees use insecure methods (e.g., browser-saved passwords without master password).

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots or documents are outdated.
- No evidence of employee awareness or training.

### False Positives
- Organization claims to use a password manager but provides no supporting evidence.
- Use of browser-based password saving without additional controls is presented as compliant.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is a trusted password manager or secure process in place and in use by all relevant employees?**
   - **Yes:** PASS
   - **No:** Go to 2

2. **Is there a reasonable justification for not using a password manager, with strong alternative controls?**
   - **Yes:** PASS or escalate for review (if justification is borderline)
   - **No:** FAIL

3. **Is there evidence of partial implementation or pilot use?**
   - **Yes:** Mark as Partial Compliance; request further evidence or clarification
   - **No:** FAIL

### Escalation Criteria
- If justification for "not feasible" is unclear or weak, escalate to senior auditor.
- If evidence is ambiguous or insufficient, request additional documentation.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and context.
- Document rationale for decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, credible evidence that a trusted password manager or secure process is in place and used by all relevant employees, or that strong alternative controls are justified and documented. Responses lacking evidence, relying on insecure practices, or providing weak justifications should be marked as FAIL. Always consider organization size and resource constraints, but maintain the baseline security standard.
