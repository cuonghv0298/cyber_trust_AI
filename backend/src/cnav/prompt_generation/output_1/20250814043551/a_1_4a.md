# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.1.4a  
**Clause: Assets: People – Equip employees with know-how to be the first line of defence**  
**Provision Requirement:** The organisation shall put in place cybersecurity awareness training for all employees to ensure that employees are aware of the security practices and behaviour expected of them. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., provide self-learning materials for employees or engaging external training providers.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
- All employees must receive some form of cybersecurity awareness training.
- Training can be delivered via self-learning materials, internal briefings, or external providers.
- The goal is to ensure employees understand basic security practices and expected behaviours (e.g., password hygiene, phishing awareness, reporting incidents).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce risk of human error leading to security incidents.
- Empower employees to recognize and respond to common cyber threats.
- Establish a culture of security awareness as a baseline defence.

**Importance:**  
- Employees are often targeted by attackers (e.g., phishing).
- Even basic awareness can prevent many common attacks.
- This is a foundational, cost-effective control for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Training Provided:** Evidence that all employees have access to, and have completed, cybersecurity awareness training.
- **Training Content:** Training covers key security topics relevant to the organization (e.g., password security, phishing, safe internet use, incident reporting).
- **Training Records:** Documentation or records exist showing who attended/received training and when.
- **Regularity:** Training is provided at onboarding and at least annually, or when significant threats/policies change.

### FAIL Criteria
- **No Training:** No evidence of any cybersecurity awareness training for employees.
- **Incomplete Coverage:** Only some employees trained, or training is ad hoc/one-off with no ongoing plan.
- **Irrelevant/Outdated Content:** Training content is not relevant to current threats or organization’s context.
- **No Records:** No documentation or records of training provided.

### Partial Compliance
- **Some Training, Not All Employees:** Training exists but not all staff have participated.
- **Informal Training:** Verbal or informal briefings with no supporting documentation.
- **Outdated Training:** Training was provided, but not within the last 12 months or not at onboarding.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Training materials (slides, handouts, online modules, links to self-learning resources).
- Attendance records, completion certificates, sign-in sheets, or HR logs.
- Emails or memos announcing training sessions.
- Invoices or contracts with external training providers.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be dated and clearly linked to the current employee population.
- Training content must be relevant to cybersecurity basics.
- Records should show coverage for all current employees.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated or refers to past employees only.
- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.
- Training is a one-off event from years ago.
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical signatures, suspiciously generic certificates).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: **HR: Any disciplinary actions for employees who fail to comply with data-security policy?**
- **What to Look For:** Existence of a policy outlining consequences for non-compliance; evidence of communication to staff.
- **Acceptable Responses:** Reference to a documented policy; examples of past enforcement (if any); staff handbook excerpts.
- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No policy,” “Not applicable,” or “We trust our staff.”
- **Follow-up Questions:**  
    - Can you provide a copy of the relevant policy section?
    - How is this policy communicated to employees?

### Q2: **HR: Is there any internal or external training you and your staff attended before? Any record (e.g., email or invoices) to prove?**
- **What to Look For:** Specifics of training provided, dates, attendee lists, and supporting documentation.
- **Acceptable Responses:**  
    - “All staff completed online cybersecurity training in March 2024; see attached completion certificates.”
    - “We held an in-house security briefing in January 2024; see attendance sheet and slides.”
    - “Staff received self-learning materials via email; see attached email and materials.”
- **Unacceptable Responses:**  
    - “We talk about security sometimes.”
    - “No formal training, but staff know what to do.”
    - “We plan to do training next year.”
- **Follow-up Questions:**  
    - Can you provide samples of the training materials?
    - How do you ensure new staff receive training?
    - When was the last training conducted?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal training (e.g., a group briefing with documented attendance) is acceptable if evidence is provided.
- For micro-businesses, self-learning materials (e.g., government guides, online videos) distributed to all staff may suffice.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or low-cost training resources are acceptable.
- Training does not need to be bespoke or externally delivered, but must be documented and relevant.

### Industry Context
- For sectors with higher risk (e.g., finance, healthcare), training should address sector-specific threats.
- For low-risk sectors, basic awareness is sufficient.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Training only provided to IT staff, not all employees.
- Training is outdated or only provided once at company inception.
- No onboarding process for new hires.

### Documentation Issues
- No records of who attended or when.
- Training materials are generic and not tailored to organization’s needs.

### False Positives
- Organization claims “everyone knows what to do” without evidence.
- Evidence of training exists, but not for all current staff.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence that all employees have received cybersecurity awareness training?**
    - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
    - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is the training content relevant and up-to-date?**
    - **Yes:** Proceed to 3.
    - **No:** FAIL.

3. **Are there records showing who attended/received training and when?**
    - **Yes:** PASS.
    - **No:** Partial Compliance (request further evidence or clarification).

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation.
- If organization claims compliance but cannot provide any evidence, escalate to senior auditor.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and coverage across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must demonstrate that all employees have received relevant cybersecurity awareness training, with supporting evidence (materials, records, or communications). Resource-constrained organizations may use free or informal training, but must still document and track participation. Incomplete, outdated, or undocumented training should result in FAIL or Partial Compliance, with clear guidance for remediation.
