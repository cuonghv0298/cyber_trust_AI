            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must record the date of authorisation for each hardware and software asset in their asset inventory list. This date should reflect when the asset was formally approved for use, typically after obtaining relevant dispensation (e.g., email approval, approval form). The asset inventory must be updated to include this information for all new and existing assets.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure only authorized hardware and software are in use.
- Maintain traceability and accountability for asset approvals.
- Enable effective asset management and reduce risks from unauthorized or unmanaged assets.

**Context & Importance:**  
Knowing when and how assets were authorized helps prevent the use of unapproved or potentially insecure hardware/software. This is a foundational control for managing IT environments, especially in resource-constrained organizations where informal asset introduction is common.

---

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The asset inventory list **explicitly includes a field/column for the date of authorisation** for both hardware and software assets.
- For each asset, the date of authorisation is **filled in and corresponds to an approval process** (e.g., matches an email approval or approval form).
- The process for updating the inventory with authorisation dates is **clearly described** and appears to be followed consistently.
- Evidence (e.g., sample inventory, approval emails/forms) is provided and matches the inventory entries.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- The asset inventory list **does not include a date of authorisation field**.
- Dates of authorisation are **missing, blank, or inconsistently filled** for assets.
- There is **no evidence** of an approval process or the process is not followed.
- The organization cannot provide sample records or supporting documentation.

### **Partial Compliance**
- The inventory includes the date of authorisation for **some but not all** assets.
- The process is described but **not consistently implemented**.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of assets.
- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Asset inventory list (spreadsheet, database export, or similar) showing:
  - Asset name/type
  - Date of authorisation field populated
- Sample approval records (e.g., email approvals, signed forms) for selected assets

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Inventory should be **recent (within the last 3-6 months)** and reflect current assets.
- Dates of authorisation should be **plausible and match supporting approval records**.
- Approval records should be **traceable to the asset** (e.g., asset name or serial number referenced).

### **Red Flags**
- Inventory is outdated, incomplete, or missing authorisation dates.
- Approval records are generic, missing, or do not match inventory entries.
- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., all dates are the same, no real approval trail).

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Is there a clear, up-to-date asset inventory list?
- Does the inventory have a column/field for "Date of Authorisation" for each asset?
- Are dates filled in for all (or nearly all) assets?
- Is there a process described for updating the inventory with authorisation dates?
- Are there sample approval records that match the inventory entries?

### **Acceptable Responses**
- "Our asset inventory (see attached spreadsheet) includes a 'Date of Authorisation' column for each asset. We update this after receiving email approval from management (see attached sample approval emails)."
- "We use an approval form for new hardware/software. The date from the signed form is entered into the inventory (see attached sample form and inventory entry)."

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- "We keep an inventory but do not record authorisation dates."
- "We approve assets verbally and do not document the date."
- "Our inventory is not updated regularly."
- "We cannot provide sample approval records."

### **Follow-up Questions**
- "Can you provide a sample of your asset inventory showing the date of authorisation for several assets?"
- "How do you ensure the date of authorisation is recorded for each new asset?"
- "Can you show an example of an approval email or form used for authorising an asset?"

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet or even a table in a document is acceptable, as long as it includes the required fields and is kept up to date.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Manual processes (e.g., updating a spreadsheet after receiving an email approval) are acceptable if consistently followed.
- Automated asset management tools are not required.

### **Industry Context**
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter asset controls, but the baseline requirement is the same: record and maintain authorisation dates for all assets.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Missing or incomplete authorisation dates in the inventory.
- No supporting approval documentation.
- Inventory not updated after asset changes.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Inventory lists that are outdated or do not reflect current assets.
- Approval records that are not linked to specific assets.

### **False Positives**
- Inventory appears compliant but dates are all the same or clearly fabricated.
- Approval process is described but not evidenced.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Does the inventory include a date of authorisation for each asset?**
   - If YES, proceed.
   - If NO, FAIL.
2. **Are dates filled in and supported by approval records?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (if only some assets are covered).
3. **Is the process for updating the inventory described and evidenced?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, request clarification.

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is incomplete or inconsistent, request additional samples or clarification.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is suspicion of fabricated evidence or systemic non-compliance.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, regardless of size, but allow for simpler documentation in smaller organizations.
- Ensure that all assets (hardware and software) are covered, not just a subset.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must maintain an up-to-date asset inventory with the date of authorisation for each hardware and software asset, supported by approval records. Incomplete, missing, or unsupported entries should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence. Use the above criteria to ensure fair, consistent, and practical assessments.
