# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4k  
**Clause**: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them  
**Provision**: Software and hardware without approval dates shall be removed.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that all hardware and software assets in use have clear approval dates (i.e., dates when they were authorized for use or installation). Any asset—hardware or software—lacking such an approval date must be removed from the organization's environment.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent use of unauthorized or unmanaged assets, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
- Ensure all assets are tracked, managed, and periodically reviewed for security.
- Reduce risk of outdated, unsupported, or rogue devices/software in the environment.

**Context & Importance:**  
Unapproved or untracked assets are a common entry point for cyberattacks. This provision ensures organizations only use assets that are known, approved, and managed, forming a foundation for all other security controls.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a documented procedure for identifying and removing hardware/software assets without approval dates.
- The procedure is actively implemented (not just theoretical).
- There is evidence that assets without approval dates are regularly identified and removed.
- The asset inventory is up-to-date and includes approval dates for all listed assets.

### FAIL Criteria
- No procedure exists for identifying/removing assets without approval dates.
- The procedure is incomplete, not implemented, or not followed.
- Asset inventory is missing, outdated, or lacks approval dates.
- Evidence shows assets without approval dates are still in use.

### Partial Compliance
- Procedure exists but is inconsistently applied or only covers some asset types.
- Asset inventory is mostly complete but has minor gaps (e.g., a few assets missing approval dates, with a plan to address).
- Evidence is insufficient or unclear; further clarification is needed.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedure or policy for asset disposal/removal.
- Asset inventory (hardware and software) showing approval dates.
- Records/logs of recent asset removals due to missing approval dates.
- Screenshots, disposal certificates, or decommissioning logs.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Procedures should be clear, actionable, and tailored to the organization.
- Asset inventory should be complete, with approval dates visible for each asset.

### Red Flags
- Generic or template procedures not adapted to the organization.
- Inventories missing approval dates or with many “unknown” entries.
- No evidence of actual asset removal activities.
- Evidence appears fabricated, outdated, or inconsistent with responses.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question:  
**IT: What is the current procedure to dispose of physical and software assets without approval dates?**

#### What to Look For
- Existence of a documented, communicated procedure.
- Steps for identifying assets lacking approval dates.
- Defined process for removing/decommissioning such assets.
- Assignment of responsibility (who performs the checks/removal).
- Evidence of recent application of the procedure.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “We maintain an asset inventory with approval dates. Assets found without approval dates during quarterly reviews are flagged and removed within 2 weeks. Disposal is logged and reviewed by IT.”
- “Our IT policy requires all new hardware/software to be approved and dated. Any asset found without an approval date is immediately scheduled for removal, and this is documented in our asset management system.”
- Supporting evidence: Asset inventory with approval dates, removal logs, screenshots of decommissioned assets.

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We don’t have a formal procedure, but we try to keep track.”
- “We haven’t found any assets without approval dates, so we haven’t needed a procedure.”
- “We only check hardware, not software.”
- No supporting evidence or only verbal assurances.

#### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide a copy of your asset disposal/removal procedure?”
- “Show a recent example where an asset was removed due to missing approval date.”
- “How often do you review your asset inventory for missing approval dates?”
- “Who is responsible for this process?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet inventory and a basic written procedure are acceptable.
- The process can be manual but must be documented and followed.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means a periodic (e.g., quarterly or annual) review of assets, not continuous monitoring.
- Use of simple tools (spreadsheets, checklists) is acceptable.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with specialized hardware/software (e.g., medical, industrial) may have longer asset lifecycles but must still track approval dates.
- Cloud/SaaS-heavy organizations must include virtual/software assets.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Asset inventories exist but lack approval dates.
- Procedures are written but not implemented.
- Only hardware or only software is covered.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated inventories.
- No evidence of actual asset removal.
- Procedures copied from templates without customization.

### False Positives
- Stating “all assets have approval dates” without evidence.
- Listing a procedure but never applying it.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented procedure for removing assets without approval dates?**
   - No → FAIL
   - Yes → Proceed

2. **Is the procedure implemented and evidenced (recent removals, up-to-date inventory)?**
   - No → FAIL
   - Yes → Proceed

3. **Does the asset inventory include approval dates for all assets?**
   - No → Partial Compliance (request remediation plan or further evidence)
   - Yes → PASS

4. **Is the evidence credible, current, and organization-specific?**
   - No → FAIL or escalate for review
   - Yes → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or escalate to a senior auditor.
- If the organization claims all assets are approved but cannot show inventory or removal records, escalate.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scale (e.g., spreadsheet vs. asset management tool).
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, implemented procedure for removing hardware/software assets without approval dates, supported by up-to-date inventories and evidence of recent removals. Responses lacking documentation, implementation, or credible evidence should result in a FAIL or require further investigation. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement: unapproved assets must not remain in use.
