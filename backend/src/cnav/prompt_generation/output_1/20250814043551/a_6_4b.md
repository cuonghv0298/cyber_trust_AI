# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4b  
**Clause:** Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software  
**Provision Requirement:** Weak or default configurations shall be avoided or updated before using them, e.g., changing default password and performing deep scanning with anti-malware solution instead of standard scan.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that all hardware and software are configured securely before being put into use. This includes:
- Changing or disabling default passwords and accounts.
- Avoiding or updating any weak/default settings (e.g., open ports, default admin usernames).
- Using enhanced security features where available (e.g., deep scanning with anti-malware, not just standard/quick scans).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access due to predictable or well-known default settings.
- Reduce the attack surface by eliminating weak configurations.
- Ensure that security controls are operating at a level that provides meaningful protection.

**Context/Importance:**  
Default configurations are widely known and exploited by attackers. Changing these settings is a fundamental step in preventing common attacks, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization **explicitly states** that default passwords and settings are changed or disabled on all new hardware/software before use.
- There is a **documented process or checklist** for secure configuration (even if informal or simple).
- The organization **performs deep/complete anti-malware scans** (not just quick scans) before deploying new systems.
- Evidence (if provided) **demonstrates actual implementation** (e.g., screenshots, configuration logs, policy documents).

### FAIL Criteria
- The organization **admits to using default passwords/settings** or cannot confirm they are changed.
- No process or practice is described for secure configuration.
- Only standard/quick anti-malware scans are performed, or no scans at all.
- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or clearly fabricated.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization changes some, but not all, default settings (e.g., only on servers, not on workstations).
- The process is ad hoc or inconsistently applied.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the environment.
- In these cases, request clarification or additional evidence.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedures, checklists, or policies (even if brief or informal).
- Screenshots showing changed settings (e.g., password change screens, disabled default accounts).
- Anti-malware scan logs or screenshots showing deep/complete scans.
- Asset setup records or onboarding checklists.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last 12 months or since last major deployment).
- Should **clearly show** that default/weak settings are addressed.
- Screenshots/logs should be **specific** (not generic images from the internet).
- If no formal documentation exists, a clear description of the process and a sample screenshot is acceptable for small organizations.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated, generic, or not tied to the organization’s actual systems.
- Descriptions are vague (“We try to change passwords”) or non-committal.
- No mention of anti-malware scanning or only quick scans are referenced.
- Evidence is identical across multiple unrelated questions (copy-paste).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear statement that default passwords/settings are changed or disabled.
- Description or evidence of a process/checklist for secure configuration.
- Confirmation that deep/complete anti-malware scans are performed before use.
- Evidence that covers all relevant device types (servers, workstations, network devices, etc.).

### Acceptable Responses
- “We change all default passwords on new devices before use. We use a setup checklist to ensure all default accounts are disabled, and we run a full anti-malware scan before connecting to the network. See attached screenshot of our checklist and scan log.”
- “Our IT vendor configures all new laptops with unique passwords and disables default admin accounts. We require a deep scan with our anti-virus before deployment. Attached is a sample configuration report.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We use the default settings because they are secure enough.”
- “We don’t know if the passwords are changed; our vendor handles it.”
- “We only run a quick scan because it’s faster.”
- No evidence or only generic statements without specifics.

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide a sample screenshot or checklist showing the configuration steps?”
- “How do you ensure that all devices (including printers, routers, etc.) have default settings changed?”
- “When was the last time you reviewed or updated your configuration process?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal checklists or verbal confirmation with a screenshot may suffice.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized procedures and broader coverage.

### Resource Constraints
- Accept simple, practical processes (e.g., a one-page checklist) if consistently applied.
- Do not require enterprise-grade configuration management tools.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements; however, baseline expectations remain the same for Cyber Essentials.
- For organizations using managed service providers, ensure the provider’s process meets the same standards.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only changing passwords on some devices, not all.
- Overlooking network devices (routers, switches) or IoT devices.
- Assuming vendor defaults are secure without verification.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence or only providing policy documents without proof of implementation.
- Outdated evidence (older than 12 months or before last major deployment).

### False Positives
- Responses that claim compliance but provide no supporting evidence.
- Evidence that is not specific to the organization’s environment.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the response clearly state that all default/weak settings are changed or disabled before use?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Go to 2

2. **Is there evidence (or a credible description) of a process/checklist for secure configuration?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Go to 3

3. **Is there confirmation that deep/complete anti-malware scans are performed before use?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Go to 4

4. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and credible?**
   - **No** → Partial Compliance (request more info)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional clarification/evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical evidence that the organization avoids or updates weak/default configurations before use, including changing default passwords and performing deep anti-malware scans. Accept simple but consistent processes for small organizations, but require evidence of actual implementation. Responses lacking specifics, evidence, or only covering part of the environment should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance, with follow-up as needed.
