# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4i  
**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  
**Provision: An authorisation process shall be developed to onboard new hardware and software into the organisation.**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must have a defined process for authorizing the addition of new hardware and software. This process should ensure that only approved, legitimate, and secure assets are introduced into the environment. The process can be simple (e.g., email approval from a manager) or more formal (e.g., documented procedures, asset whitelisting/blacklisting, malware scans), depending on the organization's size and resources.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized or malicious hardware/software from entering the environment.
- Ensure all assets are accounted for and can be managed/protected.
- Reduce risk of malware, data breaches, or operational disruption from unvetted assets.

**Context and Importance:**  
Uncontrolled introduction of hardware or software is a common vector for malware, data leaks, and unauthorized access. Even small organizations are at risk if they lack basic controls over what is connected to their network or installed on their systems.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- There is a **clear, repeatable process** for authorizing new hardware and software.
- The process involves **explicit approval** (e.g., by a manager, IT lead, or owner).
- The process includes **verification of source** (e.g., only from official/trusted vendors).
- There is **some form of security check** (e.g., malware scan, check against a whitelist/blacklist).
- The process is **communicated to relevant staff** and is **actually followed**.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process exists, or the process is ad hoc/undefined.
- Anyone can add hardware/software without oversight.
- No approval or verification step is described.
- The process is described but not implemented in practice.
- The process relies solely on trust or verbal agreements.

### Partial Compliance
- A process exists but is informal (e.g., verbal approval only).
- The process covers either hardware or software, but not both.
- The process is new or inconsistently applied.
- Some security checks are missing (e.g., no malware scan, but approval exists).

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written procedure, policy, or process document (even if brief or informal).
- Sample approval emails or records (with sensitive info redacted).
- Screenshots of asset onboarding forms, checklists, or logs.
- Evidence of malware scans or verification steps.
- Asset inventory showing recent additions and approval records.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **current** (within the last 12 months).
- Evidence should be **specific** (shows actual use, not just templates).
- Evidence should **match the described process** in the self-assessment.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, outdated, or unrelated to onboarding.
- No proof of actual approvals or security checks.
- Evidence is copied from templates with no organization-specific details.
- Contradictions between described process and provided artifacts.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Dependent Question:  
**"What is the authorisation process to onboard new hardware and software into the organisation?"**

#### What to Look For
- Description of **who** approves new hardware/software.
- **How** approval is given (email, form, verbal, etc.).
- **Verification steps** (trusted source, malware scan, etc.).
- **Record-keeping** (logs, emails, inventory updates).
- Evidence that the process is **communicated and followed**.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "All new hardware/software requests are sent to the IT manager for approval via email. Only purchases from approved vendors are allowed. After delivery, IT scans devices/software for malware before installation. Approval emails and scan logs are kept in a shared folder."
- "Staff must fill out a hardware/software request form, which is reviewed by the business owner. Only after approval can the purchase be made. Devices are checked against our asset whitelist and scanned for viruses before use."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "Anyone can install what they need."
- "We trust our staff to make good decisions."
- "We don't have a formal process, but we usually check with the boss."
- "No approval is needed for software downloads."

#### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide a recent example of an approved hardware/software onboarding?
- How do you ensure that only trusted sources are used?
- Who is responsible for performing malware scans or verification?
- How is the process communicated to staff?

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple email approval or owner sign-off is acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect more formal documentation and record-keeping.

### Resource Constraints
- The process does not need to be complex or automated; manual steps are acceptable if consistently applied.
- Malware scans can be performed with free or built-in tools.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with regulatory requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare) may need stricter controls.
- Organizations with remote or field staff may need remote approval mechanisms.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Process exists only for hardware, not software (or vice versa).
- Approval is implied but not documented.
- No verification of source or security checks.

### Documentation Issues
- No evidence of actual approvals or onboarding events.
- Outdated or irrelevant artifacts.
- Policies that are not communicated or enforced.

### False Positives
- Descriptions that sound compliant but lack supporting evidence.
- Policies copied from templates with no proof of implementation.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a described process for authorizing new hardware/software?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Does the process include explicit approval and verification steps?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Is there evidence that the process is followed (e.g., approval records, scan logs)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
4. **Is the process applied to both hardware and software?**
   - If NO → Partial Compliance (request clarification)
5. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**
   - If NO → Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on severity)

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or missing, request additional documentation.
- If the process is informal but appears to be followed, escalate to senior auditor for judgment.
- If there are sector-specific requirements, consult with a subject matter expert.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline cases.
- Ensure that evidence supports both the existence and implementation of the process.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, consistently applied process for authorizing new hardware and software, with supporting evidence that approvals and security checks are performed. The process should be proportionate to the organization's size and resources but must be more than informal or verbal agreements. Evidence must be current, specific, and demonstrate actual implementation. Use the decision tree and practical considerations to ensure fair and consistent assessments.
