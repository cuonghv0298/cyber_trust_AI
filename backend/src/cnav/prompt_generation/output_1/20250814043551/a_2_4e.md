# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4e  
**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  
**Provision Requirement:** The inventory list should contain the details of the software assets where available, as follows:  
– Software name;  
– Software publisher;  
– Software version;  
– Business purpose;  
– Asset classification;  
– Approval/authorised date;  
– End-of-support (EOS) date.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must maintain a software asset inventory that includes, for each software item (where available):  
- Name  
- Publisher  
- Version  
- Business purpose  
- Asset classification (e.g., confidential, internal, public)  
- Approval/authorised date (when it was approved for use)  
- End-of-support (EOS) date (when vendor support ends)

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure all software is known, tracked, and managed.
- Enable timely updates, patching, and decommissioning of unsupported software.
- Reduce risk of unapproved or obsolete software introducing vulnerabilities.

**Context/Importance:**  
Untracked or unsupported software is a common attack vector. Maintaining a detailed inventory is foundational for effective software management and risk reduction, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The inventory **exists** and is **current** (updated within the last 12 months).
- For **all software in use**, the inventory includes **all required fields** (name, publisher, version, business purpose, classification, approval date, EOS date) **where available**.
- If a field is not available for a specific software, a **clear explanation** is provided (e.g., EOS date not published by vendor).
- Evidence demonstrates the inventory is **actively maintained** (not a one-off exercise).

### FAIL Criteria
- No inventory is provided, or inventory is **missing entirely**.
- Inventory **omits required fields** for most or all software, with no explanation.
- Inventory is **outdated** (not updated in the last 12 months).
- Inventory is **incomplete** (e.g., only lists software names, or only covers a subset of software in use).
- No evidence of **approval/authorised date** or **EOS date** for any software, with no justification.

### Partial Compliance
- Inventory includes **most** required fields, but some are missing for a minority of software items, with **reasonable explanations**.
- Inventory is **mostly complete**, but a few software items are missing, with a plan to address gaps.
- Inventory is **recent** but not fully up to date (e.g., last updated 13-15 months ago), with evidence of intent to update.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- **Software inventory list** (spreadsheet, database export, asset management tool report, etc.).
- **Screenshots** of inventory system or asset management tool.
- **Sample entries** showing all required fields.
- **Policy or procedure** describing how inventory is maintained (optional but strengthens evidence).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Inventory should be **structured** (table or list format) and **legible**.
- **All required fields** should be present as columns or data points.
- **Sample entries** should be representative of actual software in use.
- Evidence should be **recent** (dated within the last 12 months).

### Red Flags
- Inventory is a **static document** with no indication of recent updates.
- **Handwritten lists** or unstructured notes.
- **Missing fields** with no explanation.
- **Obvious gaps** (e.g., only operating systems listed, no business applications).
- **Fabricated evidence** (e.g., template with no real data, identical approval/EOS dates for all software).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- **Presence of all required fields** for each software item.
- **Completeness**: Does the inventory cover all major software in use?
- **Currency**: Is the inventory up to date?
- **Clarity**: Are missing fields explained (e.g., "EOS date not available for open-source software")?
- **Evidence of process**: Is there a method for keeping the inventory updated?

### Acceptable Responses
- Inventory spreadsheet with columns for all required fields, filled for each software item.
- Asset management tool export showing all fields.
- Explanation for any missing data (e.g., "Approval date not tracked for legacy software, will be added in next review").
- Evidence of recent review or update (e.g., "Last updated: March 2024").

### Unacceptable Responses
- Inventory only lists software names or versions, with no other fields.
- Inventory is outdated (e.g., last updated 2+ years ago).
- No inventory provided, or only a verbal/written statement that "we have an inventory".
- No explanation for missing fields.

### Follow-up Questions
- "How often is the software inventory reviewed and updated?"
- "Can you provide a sample entry for a typical business application?"
- "How do you determine and record the EOS date for each software?"
- "What is your process for approving new software and recording the approval date?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For **very small organizations** (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet is acceptable if it covers all required fields.
- For **larger organizations**, expect more formalized inventories (e.g., asset management tools).

### Resource Constraints
- If certain fields (e.g., EOS date) are genuinely unavailable, a **reasonable explanation** is acceptable.
- "Reasonable effort" means attempting to obtain all required information, not perfection.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors may use specialized or legacy software with limited vendor information; explanations should be documented.
- Cloud/SaaS software should also be included in the inventory.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Missing EOS dates or approval dates.
- Inventory only covers operating systems, not all business applications.
- Inventory not updated regularly.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is a template, not actual data.
- Inventory is not dated or lacks update history.

### False Positives
- Inventory appears complete but is not representative (e.g., only lists a few software items).
- All fields are filled with identical or placeholder data.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is a software inventory provided?**
   - No → **FAIL**
   - Yes → Continue

2. **Does the inventory include all required fields for each software item (where available)?**
   - Yes → Continue
   - No, and no explanation → **FAIL**
   - No, but reasonable explanation → Consider **Partial Compliance**

3. **Is the inventory current (updated within 12 months)?**
   - Yes → **PASS**
   - No → **FAIL** or **Partial Compliance** if only slightly outdated and plan exists

4. **Is the evidence credible and representative?**
   - Yes → **PASS**
   - No → **FAIL**

### Escalation Criteria
- If significant fields are missing but explanations are provided, or if evidence is ambiguous, **escalate to senior auditor** or **request additional evidence**.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for any **Partial Compliance** or exceptions.

---

**Summary:**  
A PASS requires a current, complete software inventory with all required fields (where available), credible evidence, and reasonable explanations for any missing data. Incomplete, outdated, or unsubstantiated inventories should result in a FAIL. Use follow-up questions and escalation as needed for ambiguous cases. Adjust expectations proportionately for very small organizations, but do not waive essential requirements.
