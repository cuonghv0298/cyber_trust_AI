Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.1.4a  \n**Clause: Assets: People – Equip employees with know-how to be the first line of defence**  \n**Provision Requirement:** The organisation shall put in place cybersecurity awareness training for all employees to ensure that employees are aware of the security practices and behaviour expected of them. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., provide self-learning materials for employees or engaging external training providers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \n- All employees must receive some form of cybersecurity awareness training.\n- Training can be delivered via self-learning materials, internal briefings, or external providers.\n- The goal is to ensure employees understand basic security practices and expected behaviours (e.g., password hygiene, phishing awareness, reporting incidents).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Reduce risk of human error leading to security incidents.\n- Empower employees to recognize and respond to common cyber threats.\n- Establish a culture of security awareness as a baseline defence.\n\n**Importance:**  \n- Employees are often targeted by attackers (e.g., phishing).\n- Even basic awareness can prevent many common attacks.\n- This is a foundational, cost-effective control for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Training Provided:** Evidence that all employees have access to, and have completed, cybersecurity awareness training.\n- **Training Content:** Training covers key security topics relevant to the organization (e.g., password security, phishing, safe internet use, incident reporting).\n- **Training Records:** Documentation or records exist showing who attended/received training and when.\n- **Regularity:** Training is provided at onboarding and at least annually, or when significant threats/policies change.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- **No Training:** No evidence of any cybersecurity awareness training for employees.\n- **Incomplete Coverage:** Only some employees trained, or training is ad hoc/one-off with no ongoing plan.\n- **Irrelevant/Outdated Content:** Training content is not relevant to current threats or organization’s context.\n- **No Records:** No documentation or records of training provided.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- **Some Training, Not All Employees:** Training exists but not all staff have participated.\n- **Informal Training:** Verbal or informal briefings with no supporting documentation.\n- **Outdated Training:** Training was provided, but not within the last 12 months or not at onboarding.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Training materials (slides, handouts, online modules, links to self-learning resources).\n- Attendance records, completion certificates, sign-in sheets, or HR logs.\n- Emails or memos announcing training sessions.\n- Invoices or contracts with external training providers.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be dated and clearly linked to the current employee population.\n- Training content must be relevant to cybersecurity basics.\n- Records should show coverage for all current employees.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated or refers to past employees only.\n- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.\n- Training is a one-off event from years ago.\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical signatures, suspiciously generic certificates).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: **HR: Any disciplinary actions for employees who fail to comply with data-security policy?**\n- **What to Look For:** Existence of a policy outlining consequences for non-compliance; evidence of communication to staff.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** Reference to a documented policy; examples of past enforcement (if any); staff handbook excerpts.\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No policy,” “Not applicable,” or “We trust our staff.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:**  \n    - Can you provide a copy of the relevant policy section?\n    - How is this policy communicated to employees?\n\n### Q2: **HR: Is there any internal or external training you and your staff attended before? Any record (e.g., email or invoices) to prove?**\n- **What to Look For:** Specifics of training provided, dates, attendee lists, and supporting documentation.\n- **Acceptable Responses:**  \n    - “All staff completed online cybersecurity training in March 2024; see attached completion certificates.”\n    - “We held an in-house security briefing in January 2024; see attendance sheet and slides.”\n    - “Staff received self-learning materials via email; see attached email and materials.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:**  \n    - “We talk about security sometimes.”\n    - “No formal training, but staff know what to do.”\n    - “We plan to do training next year.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:**  \n    - Can you provide samples of the training materials?\n    - How do you ensure new staff receive training?\n    - When was the last training conducted?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal training (e.g., a group briefing with documented attendance) is acceptable if evidence is provided.\n- For micro-businesses, self-learning materials (e.g., government guides, online videos) distributed to all staff may suffice.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or low-cost training resources are acceptable.\n- Training does not need to be bespoke or externally delivered, but must be documented and relevant.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For sectors with higher risk (e.g., finance, healthcare), training should address sector-specific threats.\n- For low-risk sectors, basic awareness is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Training only provided to IT staff, not all employees.\n- Training is outdated or only provided once at company inception.\n- No onboarding process for new hires.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- No records of who attended or when.\n- Training materials are generic and not tailored to organization’s needs.\n\n### False Positives\n- Organization claims “everyone knows what to do” without evidence.\n- Evidence of training exists, but not for all current staff.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence that all employees have received cybersecurity awareness training?**\n    - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n    - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the training content relevant and up-to-date?**\n    - **Yes:** Proceed to 3.\n    - **No:** FAIL.\n\n3. **Are there records showing who attended/received training and when?**\n    - **Yes:** PASS.\n    - **No:** Partial Compliance (request further evidence or clarification).\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation.\n- If organization claims compliance but cannot provide any evidence, escalate to senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and coverage across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate that all employees have received relevant cybersecurity awareness training, with supporting evidence (materials, records, or communications). Resource-constrained organizations may use free or informal training, but must still document and track participation. Incomplete, outdated, or undocumented training should result in FAIL or Partial Compliance, with clear guidance for remediation.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must have developed and documented basic cyber hygiene practices and guidelines that are communicated to all employees. These should cover essential, practical steps staff must follow to protect the organization from common cyber threats in their daily work (e.g., password management, phishing awareness, safe internet use, device security).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all employees are aware of and follow minimum cybersecurity practices.\n- Reduce risk of human error leading to security incidents.\n- Establish a baseline of security-conscious behavior across the organization.\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \nEmployees are often targeted by attackers (e.g., phishing, social engineering). Clear, accessible guidelines empower staff to recognize and respond to threats, making them an effective first line of defence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has developed written or digital cyber hygiene guidelines for employees.\n- Guidelines are relevant to the organization’s operations and cover key topics (e.g., password use, email safety, device security, reporting incidents).\n- Guidelines are accessible to all employees (e.g., via handbook, intranet, posters, onboarding materials).\n- Evidence shows guidelines are current (reviewed/updated within the last 12 months).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No documented guidelines exist, or only informal/unwritten practices are described.\n- Guidelines are generic, outdated, or irrelevant to the organization’s context.\n- Employees are not aware of any such guidelines, or there is no evidence of communication/dissemination.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Guidelines exist but are incomplete (e.g., missing key topics, not tailored to daily operations).\n- Guidelines are outdated (not reviewed in the last 12 months).\n- Evidence of guidelines exists, but unclear if all employees have access or are aware.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Copies of cyber hygiene guidelines, policies, or handbooks.\n- Screenshots of intranet pages, emails, or training materials referencing the guidelines.\n- Records of guideline dissemination (e.g., onboarding checklists, staff emails).\n- Evidence of recent review or update (e.g., document version history, review dates).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be organization-specific, not generic templates.\n- Guidelines should be clear, concise, and understandable for non-technical staff.\n- Evidence should demonstrate both existence and communication of guidelines.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Only policy titles or table of contents provided, without actual content.\n- Evidence is a generic template with no customization.\n- Guidelines are dated more than 12 months ago with no sign of review.\n- No evidence of employee access or awareness.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Existence of documented cyber hygiene guidelines.\n- Coverage of key topics relevant to daily operations.\n- Evidence that guidelines are communicated and accessible to all staff.\n- Recent review or update of guidelines.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We have a cyber hygiene handbook distributed to all staff, covering password management, phishing, device security, and reporting procedures. Last updated March 2024. See attached PDF and onboarding checklist.”\n- “Guidelines are posted on our intranet and included in new hire orientation. See screenshots and sample orientation agenda.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We tell staff to be careful with emails, but there is nothing written down.”\n- “We have a policy, but it’s from 2021 and hasn’t been updated.”\n- “Staff are expected to use common sense; no formal guidelines exist.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide a copy or screenshot of the guidelines?\n- How are these guidelines communicated to new and existing staff?\n- When were the guidelines last reviewed or updated?\n- How do you ensure all employees are aware of and understand these guidelines?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple one-page guideline or checklist is acceptable if it covers key topics and is shared with all staff.\n- Formal training is not required, but evidence of communication (e.g., email, printed notice) is expected.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Guidelines do not need to be lengthy or complex; clarity and relevance are more important.\n- Use of free government or industry resources is acceptable if adapted to the organization’s context.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Guidelines should reflect sector-specific risks (e.g., handling customer data in retail, remote work in professional services).\n- Highly technical requirements are not expected for non-IT staff.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Guidelines exist but are not communicated to all staff.\n- Only IT staff receive guidelines; non-technical staff are excluded.\n- Guidelines are too generic or copied from external sources without adaptation.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated documents with no evidence of review.\n- Only policy names or summaries provided, not the actual content.\n\n### False Positives\n- Organization claims to have guidelines but cannot produce evidence.\n- Guidelines exist but are not relevant to daily employee activities.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are documented cyber hygiene guidelines present?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n2. **Do guidelines cover key topics relevant to daily operations?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n3. **Are guidelines accessible and communicated to all employees?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n4. **Are guidelines current (reviewed/updated within 12 months)?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request update/review evidence)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes requirements or provides conflicting information.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scaling based on size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must provide evidence of clear, current, and communicated cyber hygiene guidelines relevant to employees’ daily operations. Auditors should look for practical, accessible documentation and evidence of dissemination, considering the organization’s size and resources. Incomplete, outdated, or generic responses should result in FAIL or require further investigation.",

Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**HR: Are the training topics covering phishing, password management, etc.? Share the topics or training guides.**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- A list or summary of training topics that **explicitly** mentions all six required areas.\n- Attached or referenced training materials/guides.\n- Evidence that these materials are distributed to all employees.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “Our annual cyber hygiene training covers: phishing awareness, setting and protecting strong passwords, securing work devices (including BYOD), incident reporting procedures, handling business-critical data, and secure practices for both office and remote work. See attached slides and staff memo.”\n- “We provide a one-page guide to all staff covering these six topics, updated every year. Attached is the latest version.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We tell staff to be careful with emails and passwords.” (No evidence or incomplete topic coverage)\n- “Only IT staff receive security training.” (Not organization-wide)\n- “We have a policy, but it’s not shared with employees.” (No dissemination)\n- “Training covers phishing and passwords, but not device protection or incident reporting.” (Missing topics)\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide the actual training materials or guides?”\n- “How do you ensure all employees receive this guidance?”\n- “When was the last time the materials were updated or reviewed?”\n- “Are personal devices used for work included in the guidance?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal briefings or a simple one-page guide are acceptable if all six topics are covered and shared with all staff.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Materials do not need to be professionally produced; clarity and coverage are more important than polish.\n- Free or government-provided templates are acceptable if adapted to the organization’s context.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For sectors with unique risks (e.g., healthcare, finance), ensure guidance addresses sector-specific data handling or remote work scenarios.\n- For organizations with no remote work, “secure remote work” guidance can be brief but should state the policy.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Missing one or more required topics (especially incident reporting or secure remote work)\n- Only IT or management staff receive training\n- Outdated or generic materials not tailored to the organization\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- No evidence of dissemination to staff\n- Materials are undated or lack version control\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that list topics but provide no supporting materials\n- Overly generic statements with no evidence of actual implementation\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are all six required topics covered in the training/guidance?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n2. **Is there evidence that the guidance is current and distributed to all staff?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance (request more evidence)\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n3. **Is the evidence specific, clear, and organization-appropriate?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers the topics, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization disputes topic relevance or if evidence authenticity is in doubt.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same topic coverage and evidence standards to all organizations, adjusting only for size and sector as outlined above.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must provide evidence that all employees receive clear, current guidance or training covering all six specified cyber hygiene topics. Evidence must be specific, accessible, and appropriate for the organization’s size and context. Incomplete, outdated, or generic responses should result in FAIL or require further investigation.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must, where feasible, provide cybersecurity training that is tailored to the roles of their staff. This means:\n- **Senior management/business leaders** should receive training relevant to their responsibilities (e.g., fostering a cybersecurity culture, setting strategy, understanding risk).\n- **General employees** should receive practical training (e.g., using strong passwords, device protection, recognizing phishing).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all staff are equipped to act as the first line of defence against cyber threats.\n- Promote a culture of cybersecurity awareness at all organizational levels.\n- Address the different risk profiles and responsibilities of management vs. general staff.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nRole-based training ensures that both leadership and staff understand their unique responsibilities and risks, reducing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This is a foundational control for organizations with limited resources, as people are often the weakest link in cybersecurity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides evidence that cybersecurity training is differentiated by role (at least two groups: management and employees).\n- Training content for **senior management** includes topics such as cybersecurity culture, strategy, or risk management.\n- Training content for **employees** covers practical security measures (e.g., password hygiene, device security, phishing awareness).\n- The differentiation is reasonable and proportionate to the organization's size and structure.\n- If the organization is very small (e.g., <5 staff), a clear rationale is provided for combined or simplified training, with evidence that all relevant topics are covered.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of differentiated training by role.\n- Only generic, undifferentiated training is provided to all staff, with no mention of management-specific content.\n- Training is missing for either management or employees.\n- The organization claims differentiation but provides no supporting evidence or details.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some differentiation is described, but evidence is incomplete or unclear (e.g., only one group’s training is documented).\n- The organization is very small and provides a plausible explanation for combined training, but the content does not cover both management and employee needs.\n- Evidence is outdated or not clearly linked to current staff roles.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Training materials (slides, agendas, handouts) showing different content for management and employees.\n- Attendance records or sign-in sheets indicating which staff attended which training.\n- Training schedules or communications specifying role-based sessions.\n- Policy documents or emails outlining the training approach.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the past 12 months).\n- Materials should clearly indicate differentiation (e.g., “Management Training Agenda” vs. “Employee Training Agenda”).\n- Attendance or completion records should map to staff roles.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague descriptions of training with no supporting materials.\n- Outdated evidence (older than 12 months).\n- Evidence that is generic or templated, not tailored to the organization.\n- No proof that management received any training distinct from employees.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Explicit mention of different training content or sessions for management and employees.\n- Evidence that management topics (culture, strategy, risk) are covered.\n- Evidence that employee topics (passwords, device security, phishing) are covered.\n- For small organizations, a rationale for combined training and confirmation that all topics are addressed.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We conduct annual cybersecurity training. Senior management attends a session on cybersecurity strategy and risk, while employees attend a session on password security and phishing. See attached agendas and attendance lists.”\n- “As a 4-person company, we conduct a single training session covering both management and employee topics.

Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), combined training is acceptable if all relevant topics are covered and the rationale is documented.\n- For larger organizations, clear role-based differentiation is expected.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or low-cost training resources are acceptable if they are relevant and role-appropriate.\n- Training does not need to be formal or externally delivered, but must be documented and role-appropriate.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For sectors with specific risks (e.g., healthcare, finance), training should reference relevant threats, but baseline differentiation is still required.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming generic training is sufficient for all roles.\n- Overlooking management’s need for strategic/cultural training.\n- Failing to update training content regularly.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence for management training.\n- Outdated or irrelevant training materials.\n- No attendance or completion records.\n\n### False Positives\n- Claiming differentiation but providing only one set of training materials.\n- Using off-the-shelf training with no adaptation for roles.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence of differentiated training for management and employees?**\n   - **Yes:** Go to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Does the evidence show management topics (culture, strategy, risk) and employee topics (practical security)?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Go to 3.\n\n3. **Is the organization very small, with a documented rationale for combined training that covers all topics?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS or PARTIAL (if some topics are missing).\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- If the organization claims constraints due to size, verify that all topics are still addressed.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is uncertainty about what constitutes reasonable differentiation for the organization’s context.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document reasons for PASS, FAIL, or PARTIAL decisions.\n- Ensure that evidence is recent, relevant, and clearly linked to staff roles.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that cybersecurity training is differentiated by role, or—where not feasible for very small organizations—that all relevant topics are covered in a combined session. Responses lacking detail, evidence, or role-specific content should be marked as FAIL. Always consider the organization’s size and resource constraints, but do not compromise on the requirement that both management and employees are equipped with appropriate cybersecurity know-how.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must conduct cybersecurity awareness initiatives for employees at least once per year. These initiatives should ensure that employees are equipped with the knowledge to act as the first line of defence against cyber threats. The provision also expects organizations to verify that employees have understood the training content, typically through a quiz or other knowledge assessment.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all employees are aware of basic cybersecurity threats and safe practices.\n- Reduce risk of human error leading to security incidents.\n- Foster a security-conscious culture within the organization.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nHuman error is a leading cause of security breaches. Regular, effective awareness training helps employees recognize and respond appropriately to phishing, malware, and other common attacks. Annual refreshers are necessary to keep pace with evolving threats and to reinforce good habits.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- Organization conducts cybersecurity awareness training for all employees at least once every 12 months.\n- There is a mechanism to test or verify that employees have understood the training (e.g., quiz, survey, or practical exercise).\n- Evidence (e.g., training records, quiz results, attendance logs) supports the claims.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No cybersecurity awareness training is conducted, or training is conducted less frequently than annually.\n- No method to verify employee understanding (no quiz, test, or equivalent).\n- No supporting evidence provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- Training is conducted, but not for all employees or not within the last 12 months.\n- Some form of knowledge check exists, but is informal or inconsistently applied.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only partially supports the claims.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Training schedules, calendars, or communications showing annual training.\n- Attendance records or sign-in sheets.\n- Copies or screenshots of quizzes, surveys, or knowledge checks.\n- Summary of quiz results or completion rates.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence should be dated and clearly linked to the last 12 months.\n- Should cover all employees or provide a reasonable explanation for any exclusions.\n- Quiz or knowledge check should be relevant to cybersecurity topics.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Evidence is undated, generic, or reused from previous years.\n- Only policy documents provided, with no proof of actual training or testing.\n- Evidence covers only a subset of employees without justification.\n- Quiz is unrelated to cybersecurity or is a token effort (e.g., one irrelevant question).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **Q1: How do you test that trainees walk away with the required knowledge? Is there a quiz conducted?**\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Description of a quiz, survey, or other assessment method.\n- Evidence of quiz content and results.\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- \"After each training session, employees complete a 10-question online quiz. Results are tracked by HR.\"\n- \"We use a phishing simulation to test awareness, and results are reviewed annually.\"\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- \"We assume employees understand the material.\"\n- \"No quiz is conducted.\"\n- \"We just send out an email with tips.\"\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- \"Can you provide a sample of the quiz or assessment?\"\n- \"How are results tracked and acted upon?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Q2: How often do you conduct cybersecurity awareness trainings?**\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Clear statement that training is conducted at least annually.\n- Evidence of recent training (within the last 12 months).\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- \"Training is conducted every October for all staff.\"\n- \"We hold annual cybersecurity awareness sessions, last held in March 2024.\"\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- \"We did training once, a few years ago.\"\n- \"Only new hires receive training.\"\n- \"We plan to do training in the future.\"\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- \"Can you provide the training schedule or attendance records?\"\n- \"When was the last training conducted?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal group training or a simple quiz is acceptable, provided it is documented and covers all staff.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Free or low-cost online training modules are acceptable.\n- Quizzes can be simple (e.g., 5–10 questions), as long as they are relevant and administered to all.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- If the organization has high staff turnover, ensure all new hires receive training within a reasonable period (e.g., within 1 month of joining).\n- For sectors with regulatory requirements, ensure training meets both Cyber Essentials and sector-specific standards.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Training is conducted but not documented.\n- Only a subset of employees (e.g., IT staff) receive training.\n- No knowledge check or assessment is performed.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Evidence is outdated or not linked to the current year.\n- No proof of quiz or assessment results.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Organization claims to conduct training but provides only a policy or plan, not proof of execution.\n- Quiz is generic or unrelated to cybersecurity.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n\n1. **Was cybersecurity awareness training conducted for all employees within the last 12 months?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n2. **Was employee understanding tested (e.g., quiz, assessment)?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n3. **Is there credible, dated evidence of both training and testing?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for frequency, coverage, and evidence quality across all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and resources.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS this provision, the organization must show that all employees receive cybersecurity awareness training at least annually, and that their understanding is tested (e.g., via a quiz), with credible evidence to support these claims. Partial or inadequate responses should be followed up, and clear failures should be documented. Always consider the organization's size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement of annual, tested awareness training for all staff.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4a  \n**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  \n**Provision Requirement:** An up-to-date asset inventory of all the hardware and software assets shall be maintained in the organisation. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., use of spreadsheet or IT asset management software to maintain the IT asset inventory.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \n- The organization must maintain a current and accurate inventory of all hardware and software assets.  \n- The inventory can be managed using simple tools (e.g., spreadsheets) or more advanced IT asset management solutions, depending on the organization's size and resources.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure the organization is aware of all devices and software in use, reducing the risk of unmanaged or unknown assets being exploited.\n- Enable effective patching, configuration, and incident response by knowing what assets exist.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \n- Untracked devices or software can become entry points for attackers.\n- Maintaining an asset inventory is foundational for all other security controls (e.g., updates, backups, incident response).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides evidence of a maintained asset inventory covering both hardware and software.\n- The inventory is up-to-date (reviewed/updated within the last 6 months).\n- The inventory includes sufficient detail (e.g., device type, owner/user, operating system, software versions).\n- There is a clear process or responsible person/team for updating the inventory.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No asset inventory is provided, or the inventory is clearly outdated (not updated in the last 12 months).\n- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only hardware or only software is listed).\n- The inventory lacks essential details (e.g., only device names, no software information).\n- The organization is unaware of how asset information is collected or maintained.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The inventory exists but is missing minor details or is slightly out of date (e.g., last updated 7-12 months ago).\n- The inventory covers most, but not all, assets (e.g., servers and laptops but not mobile devices).\n- The process for updating the inventory is informal or ad hoc.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Asset inventory file (spreadsheet, database export, screenshot of asset management tool).\n- Documentation or description of the process for updating the inventory.\n- Evidence of recent review or update (e.g., file metadata, change log, email notification).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- The inventory should be readable, organized, and cover both hardware and software.\n- Evidence should show recent activity or updates.\n- The process for maintaining the inventory should be described and appear practical for the organization’s size.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory files with old timestamps or no indication of recent updates.\n- Inventories that list only a few devices/software for a larger organization.\n- Vague or generic process descriptions (e.g., “IT handles it” with no further detail).\n- Evidence that appears fabricated (e.g., template files with no real data).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: What operating system is used for end-user devices and applications currently?\n**What to Look For:**  \n- The response should reference the asset inventory as the source of this information.\n- The answer should be consistent with the inventory provided (e.g., if Windows 10 is listed, it should appear in the inventory).\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**  \n- “We use Windows 10 and macOS for end-user devices, as listed in our asset inventory (see attached spreadsheet).”\n- “Our inventory (attached) shows all operating systems in use, including version numbers.”\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**  \n- “Not sure” or “We think it’s mostly Windows.”\n- No reference to an inventory or supporting evidence.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**  \n- “How do you ensure this information stays up to date?”\n- “Who is responsible for updating the inventory when new devices or software are added?”\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Are there any machines running that you might not be aware of? Who provides that information?\n**What to Look For:**  \n- The organization should demonstrate awareness of the risk of unknown assets.\n- There should be a process or responsible person for identifying and reporting new or unknown devices.\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**  \n- “We conduct quarterly checks to ensure all devices are accounted for. The IT manager updates the inventory.”\n- “Staff are required to inform IT of any new devices. The inventory is reviewed monthly.”\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**  \n- “We don’t know if there are unknown machines.”\n- “No one is responsible for this.”\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**  \n- “How do you detect unauthorized or unknown devices?”\n- “When was the last time the inventory was updated?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet listing all devices and software is acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect more structured inventories and clearer update processes.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual inventories are acceptable if they are kept up to date.\n- Automated tools are not required but may be used if available.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with high staff turnover or frequent device changes should have more frequent inventory updates.\n- Sectors with regulatory requirements may need more detailed inventories.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Inventory only lists hardware, not software.\n- Inventory is created once and never updated.\n- No clear responsibility for maintaining the inventory.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Inventory files are missing, incomplete, or not provided.\n- Evidence is outdated or inconsistent with responses.\n\n### False Positives\n- Inventory appears comprehensive but is not updated regularly.\n- Responses claim compliance but cannot provide supporting evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is an asset inventory provided?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n2. **Does the inventory cover both hardware and software?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n3. **Is the inventory up-to-date (reviewed/updated within 6 months)?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on how outdated)\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n4. **Is there a clear process or responsible person for maintaining the inventory?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If the inventory is incomplete or outdated but the organization demonstrates intent and a plan to improve, escalate for senior auditor review.\n- If evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent, request additional evidence or clarification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for inventory completeness and update frequency across similar organizations.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, up-to-date, and complete asset inventories (hardware and software), supported by evidence and a defined maintenance process. Responses must be practical for the organization’s size but must demonstrate real, ongoing asset management. Incomplete, outdated, or unsupported claims should result in FAIL or further investigation.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all hardware assets within the certification scope. This includes, at a minimum, servers, network devices, laptops, and computers. If the organization uses company-issued mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) or IoT devices (e.g., CCTV, smart printers, smart TVs), these must also be included in the asset inventory.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all hardware assets are known, tracked, and can be protected.\n- Reduce risk of unmanaged or unknown devices introducing vulnerabilities.\n- Enable effective incident response and asset management.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUntracked devices are a common entry point for attackers. A complete asset inventory is foundational for all other security controls (patching, access control, etc.), especially for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The asset inventory **explicitly lists** all relevant hardware types in use: servers, network devices, laptops, computers.\n- If company-issued mobile devices are used, they are **included** in the inventory.\n- If IoT devices are present, they are **included** in the inventory.\n- The inventory is **current** (updated within the last 12 months or as devices are added/removed).\n- The inventory is **accessible** and used for security management.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The inventory **omits** any relevant device category in use (e.g., mobile devices or IoT devices present but not listed).\n- The inventory is **outdated** or clearly incomplete.\n- The organization **cannot produce** an inventory or only provides a partial/informal list.\n- The inventory is **generic** (e.g., \"laptops: yes\") without specific device identification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The inventory lists most but not all device types (e.g., includes laptops and servers but omits mobile devices that are in use).\n- The inventory is present but lacks sufficient detail (e.g., device types listed but not models or identifiers).\n- The organization is in the process of updating the inventory but cannot demonstrate current completeness.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Asset inventory document** (spreadsheet, asset management tool export, or written list).\n- **Screenshots** of inventory systems or registers.\n- **Sample device labels** or photos (if used for tracking).\n- **Policy or procedure** describing how inventory is maintained (optional but supportive).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Inventory should be **dated** and show recent updates.\n- Device entries should be **specific** (e.g., \"Dell Latitude 5420 laptop, S/N 12345\").\n- All relevant device categories should be **represented**.\n- Evidence should be **consistent** with the organization's size and operations.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory is undated or last updated over a year ago.\n- Inventory only lists device types, not actual devices.\n- Inventory omits obvious device categories (e.g., mobile devices for a sales team).\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical entries, inconsistent formatting).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:\n**Does the asset inventory include all types of hardware in use, such as servers, network devices, laptops, computers, mobile devices and IoT devices?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- **Explicit mention** of each device type relevant to the organization.\n- **Evidence** that the inventory is maintained and up-to-date.\n- **Inclusion** of mobile and IoT devices if these are used.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"Yes, our asset inventory includes all servers, network switches, laptops, desktops, company-issued mobile phones, and CCTV cameras. See attached spreadsheet dated [recent date].\"\n- \"We use a Google Sheet to track all hardware assets, including laptops, desktops, WiFi routers, and iPads issued to staff. Screenshot attached.\"\n- \"Our inventory is updated quarterly and includes all IT and IoT devices in the office.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We have a list of laptops and desktops, but mobile devices are not tracked.\"\n- \"We only track computers; network devices and IoT devices are not included.\"\n- \"We do not have an asset inventory.\"\n- \"We only have a list from two years ago.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Are there any company-issued mobile devices or tablets in use? If so, please provide evidence they are included in the inventory.\"\n- \"Do you use any IoT devices (e.g., smart TVs, CCTV, smart printers)? If so, are they tracked?\"\n- \"When was the inventory last updated?\"\n- \"How do you ensure new devices are added to the inventory?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or written list is acceptable if it covers all device types.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized tracking (e.g., asset management software).\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual inventories are acceptable if they are complete and maintained.\n- No requirement for automated tools, but inventory must be **comprehensive**.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., retail, healthcare) may have more IoT devices—ensure these are not overlooked.\n- Remote/hybrid organizations may have more mobile devices; ensure these are included.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Failing to include mobile or IoT devices that are in use.\n- Inventory is only created for the audit, not maintained in practice.\n- Inventory lists device types, not actual devices.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated inventories.\n- Lack of evidence for claimed device types.\n- Inconsistent or incomplete device details.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that claim \"all devices are tracked\" but provide no evidence or only partial lists.\n- Inventories that are too generic to be actionable.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Does the inventory exist and is it current?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Does it include all relevant device types in use (servers, network devices, laptops, computers, and, if applicable, mobile and IoT devices)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Is the inventory sufficiently detailed and credible?**\n   - If NO → Partial Compliance or FAIL (seek clarification)\n4. **Is evidence provided and does it match the organization's operations?**\n   - If YES to all above → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If the inventory is incomplete or unclear, request additional evidence or clarification.\n- If there is evidence of deliberate omission or fabrication, escalate to senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nA PASS requires a current, comprehensive, and credible inventory of all hardware assets in scope, including mobile and IoT devices if used. Evidence must be provided and match the organization's actual operations. Partial or incomplete inventories, or lack of evidence, should result in FAIL or further investigation. Adjust expectations for organization size and sector, but do not compromise on the requirement for completeness and currency.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4c  \n**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  \n**Provision: The inventory list should contain details of the hardware assets where available as follows: name/model, serial number, type, location, network address, owner, classification, department, approval/authorised date, and end-of-support date.**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must maintain a hardware asset inventory that, where possible, includes the following details for each device:\n- Hardware name/model\n- Asset tag or serial number\n- Asset type (e.g., laptop, server, printer)\n- Asset location (physical or logical)\n- Network address (e.g., IP, MAC)\n- Asset owner (person or role)\n- Asset classification (e.g., confidential, public)\n- Department\n- Approval/authorised date (when asset was approved/added)\n- End of Support (EOS) date\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all hardware assets are accounted for and traceable.\n- Enable rapid response to incidents involving specific devices.\n- Support lifecycle management (e.g., timely replacement of unsupported devices).\n- Reduce risk of unmanaged or rogue devices.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nA comprehensive hardware inventory is foundational for basic cybersecurity. It enables organizations to identify, secure, and manage all devices that could be targeted or exploited. Missing or incomplete inventories are a common root cause of security incidents.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides an inventory list (spreadsheet, database, or similar) that includes **all required fields** for each hardware asset, **where information is available**.\n- For fields not applicable (e.g., network address for a standalone printer), the inventory clearly marks them as \"N/A\" or similar, with justification.\n- The inventory is **current** (updated within the last 12 months or since significant changes).\n- The inventory covers **all relevant hardware assets** (not just servers or laptops, but also network devices, printers, etc.).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The inventory is missing **multiple required fields** for most or all assets, with no justification.\n- The inventory is **outdated** (not updated in over 12 months or clearly missing recent assets).\n- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only lists some asset types, or omits key devices).\n- The organization cannot provide an inventory or only provides a generic statement without evidence.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The inventory is mostly complete but missing **one or two fields** for most assets (e.g., EOS date not tracked, but all other fields present).\n- Some fields are marked \"unknown\" or \"N/A\" without clear justification.\n- The inventory is current but only covers a subset of assets (e.g., only IT-managed devices, not user-owned devices connected to the network).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Hardware asset inventory file (spreadsheet, asset management tool export, etc.).\n- Screenshots of asset management systems showing required fields.\n- Sample records demonstrating field completion.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be **organization-specific** (not a template or blank form).\n- Inventory should show **real data** for actual assets.\n- Fields should be filled in for each asset, or marked \"N/A\" with explanation.\n- Evidence should be **recent** (dated within the last 12 months).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory is a template with no real data.\n- Inventory only lists asset names or types, with no other details.\n- Evidence is undated or clearly outdated.\n- Obvious copy-paste or fabricated entries (e.g., all assets have the same serial number).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Does the inventory include **all required fields** for each asset?\n- Are fields completed with **specific, plausible values**?\n- Are all relevant hardware types included?\n- Is the inventory **current** and **organization-specific**?\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"Yes, our inventory includes all required fields. See attached spreadsheet showing name/model, serial number, type, location, network address, owner, classification, department, approval date, and EOS date for each device.\"\n- Inventory file with columns for each required field, filled in for each asset.\n- \"For some assets (e.g., legacy printers), EOS date is marked 'N/A' as not available.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We have an inventory, but it only lists device names and types.\"\n- \"We do not track EOS dates or asset owners.\"\n- \"Our inventory is in progress and not yet complete.\"\n- \"We do not have an inventory, but plan to create one.\"\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide a sample of your inventory showing all required fields?\"\n- \"How often is the inventory updated?\"\n- \"How do you handle assets where some information is not available?\"\n- \"Does your inventory include all device types (e.g., printers, network devices, mobile devices)?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), a simple spreadsheet is acceptable.\n- For micro-businesses, some fields (e.g., department) may be \"N/A\" if not applicable.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Reasonable effort means tracking all fields **where possible**; some legacy or simple devices may lack certain data (e.g., EOS date).\n- Use of free or basic tools (Excel, Google Sheets) is acceptable.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., retail, healthcare) may have specialized devices; ensure these are included.\n- For organizations with remote or hybrid work, ensure home office devices are considered if used for business.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Missing EOS dates or approval dates.\n- Inventory only covers servers and laptops, omitting other devices.\n- Fields left blank without explanation.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is a template, not actual data.\n- Inventory is not dated or shows no recent updates.\n\n### False Positives\n- Inventory appears complete but is not organization-specific.\n- All fields are filled with identical or generic values.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is an inventory provided with all required fields for each asset?**\n   - **Yes:** Go to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Are all fields completed or marked \"N/A\" with justification?**\n   - **Yes:** Go to 3.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.\n\n3. **Is the inventory current and covers all relevant assets?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If inventory is mostly complete but missing a few fields, request clarification or additional evidence.\n- If evidence appears fabricated or incomplete, escalate to senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for completeness and currency across all organizations.\n- Allow reasonable flexibility for very small organizations, but all required fields must be addressed where possible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must provide a current, organization-specific hardware inventory that includes all required fields for each asset, with reasonable explanations for any \"N/A\" entries. Incomplete, outdated, or generic inventories should result in FAIL or Partial Compliance, with clear documentation of gaps and follow-up actions.",

If the scope of certification includes a cloud environment: Organisation shall include what is hosted on the cloud instances, e.g., software and Operating System (OS).**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \n- The organization must maintain an up-to-date inventory of all software assets within the certification scope.  \n- This inventory must include all software applications used by the organization, including those installed or hosted on cloud instances (e.g., SaaS, IaaS, PaaS).  \n- For cloud environments, the inventory must specify what is hosted on each cloud instance, including both applications and operating systems.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure visibility and control over all software assets to reduce the risk of unmonitored or unauthorized software, which can be exploited by attackers.\n- Enable effective patch management, vulnerability assessment, and incident response by knowing what software is in use and where it resides.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \n- Untracked software, especially in cloud environments, is a common attack vector.\n- Maintaining a comprehensive software inventory is foundational for all subsequent security controls (e.g., updates, access control).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides a current, comprehensive software inventory covering all in-scope assets.\n- The inventory explicitly lists software applications on both on-premises and cloud environments.\n- For cloud instances, the inventory details what is hosted (applications and OS).\n- The inventory is documented (e.g., spreadsheet, asset management tool export) and appears to be maintained (not a one-off or outdated list).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The inventory omits cloud-hosted software or does not mention cloud environments where they are in use.\n- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only lists on-premises software, or only major applications).\n- No inventory is provided, or the response is purely verbal/unsupported.\n- The inventory is clearly outdated (e.g., references obsolete systems, last updated over a year ago).\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The inventory includes most, but not all, software assets (e.g., cloud applications are listed, but OS details are missing).\n- The inventory is present but lacks sufficient detail (e.g., generic entries like “cloud apps” without specifics).\n- The inventory is up-to-date but only covers a subset of the organization (e.g., only one department).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Software asset inventory document (spreadsheet, asset management system export, or similar).\n- Screenshots of asset management tools or cloud dashboards showing software listings.\n- Policy or procedure describing how the inventory is maintained and updated.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be dated within the last 12 months (preferably within 6 months).\n- The inventory should be specific: software names, versions, deployment locations (on-prem/cloud), and for cloud, the instance or service name.\n- Evidence should be consistent with the organization’s size and IT environment.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory lists only generic categories (e.g., “Office software”) without specifics.\n- No mention of cloud assets when the organization uses cloud services.\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., template with no organization-specific details).\n- Inventory is a static document with no indication of regular updates.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Confirmation that the inventory includes all applications, including those on cloud instances.\n- Explicit mention of cloud-hosted software and OS, if cloud is in scope.\n- Evidence that the inventory is maintained and updated regularly.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Our software inventory includes all applications used by the organization, including those hosted on AWS and Microsoft 365. See attached spreadsheet dated [recent date], listing all software and OS for each cloud instance.”\n- “We use [asset management tool] to track all software, including cloud-hosted applications. Attached are screenshots showing our current inventory, including cloud VMs and their OS.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We keep a list of our main software, but cloud applications are managed by the provider.”\n- “We only track on-premises software; cloud is out of scope.”\n- “We do not have a formal inventory, but IT knows what we use.”\n- No evidence provided, or evidence is clearly outdated.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide a sample of your inventory showing both on-premises and cloud-hosted software?”\n- “How often is your software inventory reviewed and updated?”\n- “How do you ensure new cloud applications are added to the inventory?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or document listing all software (including cloud apps and OS) is acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect more structured inventories, possibly from asset management tools.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual inventories are acceptable if they are complete and regularly updated.\n- Automated tools are not required but are a best practice for larger or more complex environments.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations in sectors with heavy cloud reliance (e.g., SaaS businesses) must show clear cloud asset tracking.\n- For organizations with minimal IT, ensure at least basic cloud services (e.g., email, file storage) are included.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking cloud-hosted software or assuming the provider is responsible for inventory.\n- Only listing major or licensed software, omitting free or open-source tools.\n- Inventory is created for the audit but not maintained in practice.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Inventory is undated or lacks version history.\n- Evidence is a generic template, not organization-specific.\n- Inventory does not distinguish between on-premises and cloud assets.\n\n### False Positives\n- Inventory lists cloud providers (e.g., “AWS”) but not what is actually hosted (applications, OS).\n- Inventory includes only application names, omitting OS for cloud VMs.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented software inventory?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n2. **Does the inventory include all in-scope applications, including those on cloud instances?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n3. **For cloud environments, does the inventory specify what is hosted (applications and OS)?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial (if some details are present)\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n\n4. **Is the inventory current (updated within the last 12 months) and organization-specific?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If the inventory is incomplete or ambiguous, request additional evidence or clarification.\n- If the organization claims not to use cloud but other evidence suggests otherwise, escalate for further review.\n- For partial compliance, consult with a senior auditor to determine if remediation or additional evidence is required.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Ensure that evidence is organization-specific and not generic or templated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS this provision, the organization must provide a current, comprehensive, and organization-specific inventory of all software assets, including those hosted on cloud instances (with details on applications and OS). Evidence must be credible, complete, and reflect actual practice, not just a one-off list for the audit. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept omission of cloud assets or outdated/incomplete inventories.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must maintain a software asset inventory that includes, for each software item (where available):  \n- Name  \n- Publisher  \n- Version  \n- Business purpose  \n- Asset classification (e.g., confidential, internal, public)  \n- Approval/authorised date (when it was approved for use)  \n- End-of-support (EOS) date (when vendor support ends)\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all software is known, tracked, and managed.\n- Enable timely updates, patching, and decommissioning of unsupported software.\n- Reduce risk of unapproved or obsolete software introducing vulnerabilities.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nUntracked or unsupported software is a common attack vector. Maintaining a detailed inventory is foundational for effective software management and risk reduction, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The inventory **exists** and is **current** (updated within the last 12 months).\n- For **all software in use**, the inventory includes **all required fields** (name, publisher, version, business purpose, classification, approval date, EOS date) **where available**.\n- If a field is not available for a specific software, a **clear explanation** is provided (e.g., EOS date not published by vendor).\n- Evidence demonstrates the inventory is **actively maintained** (not a one-off exercise).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No inventory is provided, or inventory is **missing entirely**.\n- Inventory **omits required fields** for most or all software, with no explanation.\n- Inventory is **outdated** (not updated in the last 12 months).\n- Inventory is **incomplete** (e.g., only lists software names, or only covers a subset of software in use).\n- No evidence of **approval/authorised date** or **EOS date** for any software, with no justification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Inventory includes **most** required fields, but some are missing for a minority of software items, with **reasonable explanations**.\n- Inventory is **mostly complete**, but a few software items are missing, with a plan to address gaps.\n- Inventory is **recent** but not fully up to date (e.g., last updated 13-15 months ago), with evidence of intent to update.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Software inventory list** (spreadsheet, database export, asset management tool report, etc.).\n- **Screenshots** of inventory system or asset management tool.\n- **Sample entries** showing all required fields.\n- **Policy or procedure** describing how inventory is maintained (optional but strengthens evidence).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Inventory should be **structured** (table or list format) and **legible**.\n- **All required fields** should be present as columns or data points.\n- **Sample entries** should be representative of actual software in use.\n- Evidence should be **recent** (dated within the last 12 months).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory is a **static document** with no indication of recent updates.\n- **Handwritten lists** or unstructured notes.\n- **Missing fields** with no explanation.\n- **Obvious gaps** (e.g., only operating systems listed, no business applications).\n- **Fabricated evidence** (e.g., template with no real data, identical approval/EOS dates for all software).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- **Presence of all required fields** for each software item.\n- **Completeness**: Does the inventory cover all major software in use?\n- **Currency**: Is the inventory up to date?\n- **Clarity**: Are missing fields explained (e.g., \"EOS date not available for open-source software\")?\n- **Evidence of process**: Is there a method for keeping the inventory updated?\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- Inventory spreadsheet with columns for all required fields, filled for each software item.\n- Asset management tool export showing all fields.\n- Explanation for any missing data (e.g., \"Approval date not tracked for legacy software, will be added in next review\").\n- Evidence of recent review or update (e.g., \"Last updated: March 2024\").\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- Inventory only lists software names or versions, with no other fields.\n- Inventory is outdated (e.g., last updated 2+ years ago).\n- No inventory provided, or only a verbal/written statement that \"we have an inventory\".\n- No explanation for missing fields.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- \"How often is the software inventory reviewed and updated?\"\n- \"Can you provide a sample entry for a typical business application?\"\n- \"How do you determine and record the EOS date for each software?\"\n- \"What is your process for approving new software and recording the approval date?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For **very small organizations** (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet is acceptable if it covers all required fields.\n- For **larger organizations**, expect more formalized inventories (e.g., asset management tools).\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- If certain fields (e.g., EOS date) are genuinely unavailable, a **reasonable explanation** is acceptable.\n- \"Reasonable effort\" means attempting to obtain all required information, not perfection.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors may use specialized or legacy software with limited vendor information; explanations should be documented.\n- Cloud/SaaS software should also be included in the inventory.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Missing EOS dates or approval dates.\n- Inventory only covers operating systems, not all business applications.\n- Inventory not updated regularly.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is a template, not actual data.\n- Inventory is not dated or lacks update history.\n\n### False Positives\n- Inventory appears complete but is not representative (e.g., only lists a few software items).\n- All fields are filled with identical or placeholder data.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is a software inventory provided?**\n   - No → **FAIL**\n   - Yes → Continue\n\n2. **Does the inventory include all required fields for each software item (where available)?**\n   - Yes → Continue\n   - No, and no explanation → **FAIL**\n   - No, but reasonable explanation → Consider **Partial Compliance**\n\n3. **Is the inventory current (updated within 12 months)?**\n   - Yes → **PASS**\n   - No → **FAIL** or **Partial Compliance** if only slightly outdated and plan exists\n\n4. **Is the evidence credible and representative?**\n   - Yes → **PASS**\n   - No → **FAIL**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If significant fields are missing but explanations are provided, or if evidence is ambiguous, **escalate to senior auditor** or **request additional evidence**.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for any **Partial Compliance** or exceptions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nA PASS requires a current, complete software inventory with all required fields (where available), credible evidence, and reasonable explanations for any missing data. Incomplete, outdated, or unsubstantiated inventories should result in a FAIL. Use follow-up questions and escalation as needed for ambiguous cases. Adjust expectations proportionately for very small organizations, but do not waive essential requirements.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must review their hardware and software asset inventory at least twice per year (bi-annually) as a good practice. This means there should be a formal or informal process to check, update, and verify the list of all IT assets (hardware and software) at least every six months.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure the organization is aware of all devices and software in use.\n- Identify unauthorized or outdated assets that may introduce vulnerabilities.\n- Maintain an up-to-date inventory to support patching, incident response, and risk management.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nRegular inventory reviews help organizations detect “shadow IT,” unauthorized installations, and obsolete systems that could be exploited. For resource-constrained organizations, this is a foundational step to maintain visibility and control over their IT environment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization confirms that hardware and software inventories are reviewed at least twice per year.\n- There is evidence (e.g., review logs, meeting notes, updated inventory lists with timestamps) showing two or more reviews in the past 12 months.\n- The process is repeatable and not ad hoc (i.e., not a one-off or only in response to an incident).\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- The organization cannot demonstrate that reviews occur at least twice per year.\n- No evidence of reviews, or only a single review in the past 12 months.\n- Reviews are only conducted in response to incidents or audits, not as a routine process.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- The organization claims to review inventories but only does so annually or on an irregular basis.\n- Evidence is ambiguous (e.g., undated inventory lists, unclear review frequency).\n- The process is informal and lacks documentation but may be sufficient for very small organizations if verbally described and plausible.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Inventory review logs or checklists with dates.\n- Meeting minutes or emails referencing inventory reviews.\n- Versioned inventory lists showing updates at least twice in the past year.\n- Screenshots of asset management tools with review timestamps.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence should clearly show review dates and responsible personnel.\n- Documentation should cover both hardware and software assets.\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Inventory lists with no modification or review dates.\n- Evidence only covers hardware or only software, not both.\n- Fabricated or backdated evidence (e.g., all reviews appear to have been done on the same day).\n- Vague statements without supporting documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Explicit confirmation of bi-annual (twice per year) reviews.\n- Dates of the last two reviews.\n- Evidence that reviews are part of a routine process.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “We review our hardware and software inventory every January and July. Attached are the review logs for the past two cycles.”\n- “Our IT lead updates the asset list in March and September each year. See attached inventory files with timestamps.”\n- For very small organizations: “We only have three computers and one software package. The owner checks the list every six months, as shown in these calendar reminders.”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “We review our inventory when we remember to.”\n- “We last reviewed our inventory in March last year, but not since.”\n- “We don’t keep a formal inventory, but we know what we have.”\n- “We only check our inventory when there’s a problem.”\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- “Can you provide evidence of the last two inventory reviews?”\n- “How do you document or track these reviews?”\n- “Who is responsible for conducting the reviews?”\n- “Does your review cover both hardware and software assets?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For micro or very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), informal processes may be acceptable if they are plausible and consistently applied (e.g., owner’s calendar reminders, simple checklists).\n- Larger organizations should have more formal documentation and clear assignment of responsibility.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Accept simple, low-tech solutions (e.g., Excel sheets, paper checklists) if they are used consistently.\n- Do not require enterprise-grade asset management tools.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Organizations with highly dynamic IT environments (e.g., tech startups) may need more frequent reviews.\n- Static environments (e.g., small retail shops) may have little change, but reviews must still occur at least twice per year.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Only annual reviews, or reviews done less frequently than required.\n- No evidence of review dates or responsible persons.\n- Inventory only covers hardware or only software.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Inventory lists with no timestamps or version history.\n- Evidence provided is outdated (older than 12 months).\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Organization claims compliance but cannot produce evidence.\n- Inventory list is updated, but no record of review process or frequency.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Does the organization claim to review inventories at least twice per year?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n2. **Is there credible evidence of at least two reviews in the past 12 months?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → PASS\n3. **Is the evidence recent, covers both hardware and software, and shows a repeatable process?**\n   - If YES → PASS\n   - If only partially (e.g., informal but plausible for very small orgs) → consider Partial Compliance\n   - If NO → FAIL\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization is very small and uses informal processes, but the approach is plausible and consistent, document rationale for acceptance.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and review frequency across similar organizations.\n- Document any deviations from standard criteria with justification (e.g., micro-organization with minimal assets).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and credible evidence that hardware and software inventories are reviewed at least twice per year. Accept simple, resource-appropriate processes for small organizations, but require that the process is repeatable and covers all relevant assets. Inadequate, infrequent, or undocumented reviews should result in a FAIL. Escalate ambiguous or suspicious cases for further review.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must identify all hardware and software assets in use, determine if any are unauthorised or have reached end-of-support (EOS), and ensure such assets are replaced or upgraded in a timely manner.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent use of unsupported or unauthorised hardware/software, which are more vulnerable to security threats.\n- Ensure all assets receive security updates and vendor support.\n- Reduce risk of compromise due to unpatched vulnerabilities.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUnsupported or unauthorised assets are a common entry point for attackers. This provision ensures organizations maintain a secure, up-to-date IT environment, even with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization demonstrates awareness of the EOS status of all operating systems (and, where relevant, other critical software/hardware).\n- There is a defined and implemented process for monitoring EOS status (e.g., periodic checks, vendor notifications).\n- There is a clear, actionable process for replacing or upgrading EOS or unauthorised assets.\n- Evidence shows recent or ongoing replacement/upgrade actions if EOS assets were identified.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The organization is unaware of the EOS status of its assets.\n- No process exists for monitoring EOS status.\n- No plan or process for replacing/upgrading EOS or unauthorised assets.\n- Evidence shows continued use of EOS/unauthorised assets with no mitigation or replacement plan.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization is aware of EOS status but the process for monitoring or replacement is informal, ad hoc, or incomplete.\n- Some assets have been replaced, but others remain unsupported with no clear timeline for remediation.\n- Evidence is insufficient or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Asset inventory or list showing OS/software versions and support status.\n- Documentation of monitoring process (e.g., checklists, calendar reminders, assigned responsibilities).\n- Records of recent upgrades/replacements (e.g., purchase orders, upgrade logs).\n- Screenshots or reports showing current OS/software versions.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Asset lists should be reasonably complete for the organization’s size.\n- Processes should be documented, even if simple (e.g., a checklist or email reminders).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Outdated asset lists or evidence (older than 12 months).\n- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.\n- Evidence that does not match the organization’s described environment.\n- Evidence of continued use of EOS/unauthorised assets with no action plan.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: Do you know whether the OS used is already end-of-support? If yes, what is the process of replacing/upgrading?\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Confirmation that the organization checks OS support status.\n- Description of how EOS is determined (e.g., vendor website, IT provider).\n- Clear process for replacement/upgrade (who, when, how).\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- “We maintain a list of all computers and their OS versions. We check Microsoft’s website quarterly for EOS dates. If an OS is EOS, we schedule an upgrade within 1 month.”\n- Evidence: Asset list, upgrade schedule, recent upgrade records.\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- “We don’t know if our OS is supported.”\n- “We only upgrade when something breaks.”\n- No evidence or outdated asset list.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- How often do you check for EOS status?\n- Who is responsible for monitoring and upgrading?\n- Can you provide a recent example of an upgrade?\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Is anyone monitoring whether the OS in use is no longer supported by the vendor (e.g., Microsoft)?\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Assignment of responsibility (named person or role).\n- Description of monitoring method (manual check, IT provider, automated tool).\n- Frequency of monitoring.\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- “Our office manager checks OS support status every 6 months using vendor websites.”\n- “Our IT vendor notifies us of EOS dates and recommends upgrades.”\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- “No one is responsible.”\n- “We don’t monitor this.”\n- “We assume our systems are supported.”\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- How do you ensure monitoring happens regularly?\n- What steps are taken if an EOS asset is found?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet and periodic manual check is acceptable.\n- Larger organizations should have more formalized processes.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual processes are acceptable if documented and performed regularly.\n- Outsourcing to an IT provider is acceptable if responsibilities are clear.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations in regulated sectors may need stricter controls.\n- Non-IT-intensive sectors may have fewer assets but must still comply.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Asset lists are incomplete or not maintained.\n- No regular process for checking EOS status.\n- EOS assets remain in use without a plan for replacement.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is outdated or generic.\n- No proof of recent monitoring or upgrades.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating “we are compliant” without evidence.\n- Listing assets but not showing support status or monitoring process.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence of an up-to-date asset inventory with OS/support status?**\n   - If YES, continue. If NO, FAIL.\n2. **Is there a documented process for monitoring EOS status?**\n   - If YES, continue. If NO, FAIL.\n3. **Is there evidence of timely replacement/upgrade of EOS or unauthorised assets?**\n   - If YES, PASS. If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (if a plan is in place but not yet completed).\n4. **Is responsibility for monitoring assigned and acted upon?**\n   - If YES, PASS. If NO, FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation.\n- If organization claims compliance but cannot provide evidence, escalate to senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across similar organizations.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear evidence that the organization knows the EOS status of its assets, monitors this regularly, and replaces/updates unsupported or unauthorised assets in a timely manner. Processes can be simple but must be documented and followed. Lack of awareness, process, or evidence should result in a FAIL. Partial compliance may be accepted if there is a clear, time-bound plan for remediation.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nIf the organization continues to use any hardware or software assets that have reached End-of-Support (EOS), it must:\n- **Assess and understand the risk** of continued use,\n- **Obtain explicit approval from senior management** for continued use,\n- **Monitor the asset** until it is replaced.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Ensure that EOS assets, which no longer receive security updates, are not used without understanding and managing the associated risks.\n- Involve senior management in risk acceptance decisions.\n- Maintain oversight and monitoring of EOS assets to minimize exposure until they are decommissioned.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nEOS assets are vulnerable to unpatched security flaws. Without proper risk assessment, approval, and monitoring, these assets can become easy targets for attackers. This provision ensures organizations do not ignore the risks of legacy systems and that their continued use is a conscious, managed decision.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization **identifies all EOS assets** in use.\n- There is a **documented risk assessment** for each EOS asset, outlining potential threats and mitigation measures.\n- **Senior management approval** for continued use is documented (e.g., signed memo, email, or meeting minutes).\n- There is a **procedure or evidence of ongoing monitoring** of the EOS asset (e.g., regular status checks, logs, or review schedules).\n- The organization demonstrates a **plan or timeline for replacement** of the EOS asset.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of risk assessment for EOS assets.\n- No record of senior management approval for continued use.\n- No monitoring procedure or evidence of ongoing oversight.\n- The organization is unaware of which assets are EOS.\n- Responses are generic, lack specifics, or are unsupported by evidence.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some, but not all, EOS assets are covered by risk assessments or approvals.\n- Risk assessment is superficial or lacks detail.\n- Approval is informal or not clearly from senior management.\n- Monitoring is ad-hoc or not documented.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Asset inventory** listing EOS assets.\n- **Risk assessment documents** (can be simple, e.g., a risk register entry).\n- **Senior management approval** (email, signed document, meeting minutes).\n- **Monitoring records** (logs, checklists, review notes).\n- **Replacement plan or timeline** (if available).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **current** (within the last 12 months).\n- Documents should be **specific** to the identified EOS assets.\n- Approvals must be traceable to a senior management role (e.g., CEO, Director, IT Manager).\n- Monitoring should show **ongoing activity**, not just a one-off check.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or generic.\n- Risk assessments are copy-pasted templates with no asset-specific details.\n- Approvals are from junior staff or not clearly from management.\n- Monitoring is claimed but not documented.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of EOS assets.\n- Specific risk assessment for each EOS asset.\n- Explicit, dated approval from senior management.\n- Description or evidence of monitoring activities.\n- Replacement plan or timeline.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We have two EOS Windows 7 PCs. A risk assessment was conducted (see attached), and the IT Manager approved continued use until Q4 2024. We monitor these PCs weekly for unusual activity and have scheduled replacement.\"\n- \"Our asset register flags EOS software. For each, we complete a risk form, get approval from the CEO, and review status monthly.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We know some assets are EOS but have no formal process.\"\n- \"Senior management is aware, but nothing is documented.\"\n- \"We plan to replace them soon, but no risk assessment or approval is in place.\"\n- \"We don't have any EOS assets\" (if evidence suggests otherwise).\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide the actual risk assessment document for [specific asset]?\n- Who in senior management approved continued use, and when?\n- How do you monitor the EOS asset? Can you show recent monitoring records?\n- What is your timeline for replacing this asset?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, risk assessments and approvals can be simple (e.g., a one-page document or an email chain), as long as they are specific and traceable.\n- Monitoring can be manual (e.g., a checklist or logbook).\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept basic but clear documentation (e.g., spreadsheet, email).\n- Do not require enterprise-grade risk management tools.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements for EOS assets; note if sectoral regulations apply.\n- For organizations with critical systems, ensure risk assessments are proportionate to the potential impact.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Failure to identify all EOS assets.\n- Risk assessments are missing or generic.\n- Senior management approval is assumed, not documented.\n- Monitoring is not ongoing or not evidenced.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is outdated or not asset-specific.\n- Approvals are unsigned or from inappropriate roles.\n- Monitoring records are missing or incomplete.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that mention processes but provide no supporting evidence.\n- Risk assessments that are boilerplate and not tailored to the asset.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are there any EOS assets in use?**\n   - If NO: PASS (if supported by up-to-date asset inventory).\n   - If YES: Proceed to next steps.\n\n2. **Is there a documented risk assessment for each EOS asset?**\n   - If NO: FAIL.\n   - If YES: Proceed.\n\n3. **Is there documented senior management approval for continued use?**\n   - If NO: FAIL.\n   - If YES: Proceed.\n\n4. **Is there evidence of ongoing monitoring of the EOS asset?**\n   - If NO: FAIL.\n   - If YES: PASS.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.\n- If the organization claims no EOS assets but evidence suggests otherwise, seek clarification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for documentation and approval across all organizations.\n- Accept proportionate evidence for small organizations, but require all three elements: risk assessment, management approval, and monitoring.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate (with proportionate evidence) that it has identified EOS assets, assessed and documented the risks, obtained senior management approval, and is actively monitoring the assets until replacement. Incomplete, generic, or undocumented processes should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must have a defined process for authorizing the addition of new hardware and software. This process should ensure that only approved, legitimate, and secure assets are introduced into the environment. The process can be simple (e.g., email approval from a manager) or more formal (e.g., documented procedures, asset whitelisting/blacklisting, malware scans), depending on the organization's size and resources.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized or malicious hardware/software from entering the environment.\n- Ensure all assets are accounted for and can be managed/protected.\n- Reduce risk of malware, data breaches, or operational disruption from unvetted assets.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nUncontrolled introduction of hardware or software is a common vector for malware, data leaks, and unauthorized access. Even small organizations are at risk if they lack basic controls over what is connected to their network or installed on their systems.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- There is a **clear, repeatable process** for authorizing new hardware and software.\n- The process involves **explicit approval** (e.g., by a manager, IT lead, or owner).\n- The process includes **verification of source** (e.g., only from official/trusted vendors).\n- There is **some form of security check** (e.g., malware scan, check against a whitelist/blacklist).\n- The process is **communicated to relevant staff** and is **actually followed**.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process exists, or the process is ad hoc/undefined.\n- Anyone can add hardware/software without oversight.\n- No approval or verification step is described.\n- The process is described but not implemented in practice.\n- The process relies solely on trust or verbal agreements.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- A process exists but is informal (e.g., verbal approval only).\n- The process covers either hardware or software, but not both.\n- The process is new or inconsistently applied.\n- Some security checks are missing (e.g., no malware scan, but approval exists).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedure, policy, or process document (even if brief or informal).\n- Sample approval emails or records (with sensitive info redacted).\n- Screenshots of asset onboarding forms, checklists, or logs.\n- Evidence of malware scans or verification steps.\n- Asset inventory showing recent additions and approval records.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **current** (within the last 12 months).\n- Evidence should be **specific** (shows actual use, not just templates).\n- Evidence should **match the described process** in the self-assessment.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or unrelated to onboarding.\n- No proof of actual approvals or security checks.\n- Evidence is copied from templates with no organization-specific details.\n- Contradictions between described process and provided artifacts.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Dependent Question:  \n**\"What is the authorisation process to onboard new hardware and software into the organisation?\"**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Description of **who** approves new hardware/software.\n- **How** approval is given (email, form, verbal, etc.).\n- **Verification steps** (trusted source, malware scan, etc.).\n- **Record-keeping** (logs, emails, inventory updates).\n- Evidence that the process is **communicated and followed**.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"All new hardware/software requests are sent to the IT manager for approval via email. Only purchases from approved vendors are allowed. After delivery, IT scans devices/software for malware before installation. Approval emails and scan logs are kept in a shared folder.\"\n- \"Staff must fill out a hardware/software request form, which is reviewed by the business owner. Only after approval can the purchase be made. Devices are checked against our asset whitelist and scanned for viruses before use.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"Anyone can install what they need.\"\n- \"We trust our staff to make good decisions.\"\n- \"We don't have a formal process, but we usually check with the boss.\"\n- \"No approval is needed for software downloads.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide a recent example of an approved hardware/software onboarding?\n- How do you ensure that only trusted sources are used?\n- Who is responsible for performing malware scans or verification?\n- How is the process communicated to staff?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple email approval or owner sign-off is acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formal documentation and record-keeping.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- The process does not need to be complex or automated; manual steps are acceptable if consistently applied.\n- Malware scans can be performed with free or built-in tools.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with regulatory requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare) may need stricter controls.\n- Organizations with remote or field staff may need remote approval mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Process exists only for hardware, not software (or vice versa).\n- Approval is implied but not documented.\n- No verification of source or security checks.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- No evidence of actual approvals or onboarding events.\n- Outdated or irrelevant artifacts.\n- Policies that are not communicated or enforced.\n\n### False Positives\n- Descriptions that sound compliant but lack supporting evidence.\n- Policies copied from templates with no proof of implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a described process for authorizing new hardware/software?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Does the process include explicit approval and verification steps?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Is there evidence that the process is followed (e.g., approval records, scan logs)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n4. **Is the process applied to both hardware and software?**\n   - If NO → Partial Compliance (request clarification)\n5. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**\n   - If NO → Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on severity)\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or missing, request additional documentation.\n- If the process is informal but appears to be followed, escalate to senior auditor for judgment.\n- If there are sector-specific requirements, consult with a subject matter expert.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline cases.\n- Ensure that evidence supports both the existence and implementation of the process.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, consistently applied process for authorizing new hardware and software, with supporting evidence that approvals and security checks are performed. The process should be proportionate to the organization's size and resources but must be more than informal or verbal agreements. Evidence must be current, specific, and demonstrate actual implementation. Use the decision tree and practical considerations to ensure fair and consistent assessments.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must record the date of authorisation for each hardware and software asset in their asset inventory list. This date should reflect when the asset was formally approved for use, typically after obtaining relevant dispensation (e.g., email approval, approval form). The asset inventory must be updated to include this information for all new and existing assets.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure only authorized hardware and software are in use.\n- Maintain traceability and accountability for asset approvals.\n- Enable effective asset management and reduce risks from unauthorized or unmanaged assets.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nKnowing when and how assets were authorized helps prevent the use of unapproved or potentially insecure hardware/software. This is a foundational control for managing IT environments, especially in resource-constrained organizations where informal asset introduction is common.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The asset inventory list **explicitly includes a field/column for the date of authorisation** for both hardware and software assets.\n- For each asset, the date of authorisation is **filled in and corresponds to an approval process** (e.g., matches an email approval or approval form).\n- The process for updating the inventory with authorisation dates is **clearly described** and appears to be followed consistently.\n- Evidence (e.g., sample inventory, approval emails/forms) is provided and matches the inventory entries.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- The asset inventory list **does not include a date of authorisation field**.\n- Dates of authorisation are **missing, blank, or inconsistently filled** for assets.\n- There is **no evidence** of an approval process or the process is not followed.\n- The organization cannot provide sample records or supporting documentation.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- The inventory includes the date of authorisation for **some but not all** assets.\n- The process is described but **not consistently implemented**.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of assets.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Asset inventory list (spreadsheet, database export, or similar) showing:\n  - Asset name/type\n  - Date of authorisation field populated\n- Sample approval records (e.g., email approvals, signed forms) for selected assets\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Inventory should be **recent (within the last 3-6 months)** and reflect current assets.\n- Dates of authorisation should be **plausible and match supporting approval records**.\n- Approval records should be **traceable to the asset** (e.g., asset name or serial number referenced).\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Inventory is outdated, incomplete, or missing authorisation dates.\n- Approval records are generic, missing, or do not match inventory entries.\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., all dates are the same, no real approval trail).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Is there a clear, up-to-date asset inventory list?\n- Does the inventory have a column/field for \"Date of Authorisation\" for each asset?\n- Are dates filled in for all (or nearly all) assets?\n- Is there a process described for updating the inventory with authorisation dates?\n- Are there sample approval records that match the inventory entries?\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- \"Our asset inventory (see attached spreadsheet) includes a 'Date of Authorisation' column for each asset. We update this after receiving email approval from management (see attached sample approval emails).\"\n- \"We use an approval form for new hardware/software. The date from the signed form is entered into the inventory (see attached sample form and inventory entry).\"\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- \"We keep an inventory but do not record authorisation dates.\"\n- \"We approve assets verbally and do not document the date.\"\n- \"Our inventory is not updated regularly.\"\n- \"We cannot provide sample approval records.\"\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- \"Can you provide a sample of your asset inventory showing the date of authorisation for several assets?\"\n- \"How do you ensure the date of authorisation is recorded for each new asset?\"\n- \"Can you show an example of an approval email or form used for authorising an asset?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet or even a table in a document is acceptable, as long as it includes the required fields and is kept up to date.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Manual processes (e.g., updating a spreadsheet after receiving an email approval) are acceptable if consistently followed.\n- Automated asset management tools are not required.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter asset controls, but the baseline requirement is the same: record and maintain authorisation dates for all assets.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Missing or incomplete authorisation dates in the inventory.\n- No supporting approval documentation.\n- Inventory not updated after asset changes.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Inventory lists that are outdated or do not reflect current assets.\n- Approval records that are not linked to specific assets.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Inventory appears compliant but dates are all the same or clearly fabricated.\n- Approval process is described but not evidenced.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Does the inventory include a date of authorisation for each asset?**\n   - If YES, proceed.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n2. **Are dates filled in and supported by approval records?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (if only some assets are covered).\n3. **Is the process for updating the inventory described and evidenced?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, request clarification.\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is incomplete or inconsistent, request additional samples or clarification.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is suspicion of fabricated evidence or systemic non-compliance.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, regardless of size, but allow for simpler documentation in smaller organizations.\n- Ensure that all assets (hardware and software) are covered, not just a subset.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must maintain an up-to-date asset inventory with the date of authorisation for each hardware and software asset, supported by approval records. Incomplete, missing, or unsupported entries should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence. Use the above criteria to ensure fair, consistent, and practical assessments.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that all hardware and software assets in use have clear approval dates (i.e., dates when they were authorized for use or installation). Any asset—hardware or software—lacking such an approval date must be removed from the organization's environment.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent use of unauthorized or unmanaged assets, which may introduce vulnerabilities.\n- Ensure all assets are tracked, managed, and periodically reviewed for security.\n- Reduce risk of outdated, unsupported, or rogue devices/software in the environment.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUnapproved or untracked assets are a common entry point for cyberattacks. This provision ensures organizations only use assets that are known, approved, and managed, forming a foundation for all other security controls.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a documented procedure for identifying and removing hardware/software assets without approval dates.\n- The procedure is actively implemented (not just theoretical).\n- There is evidence that assets without approval dates are regularly identified and removed.\n- The asset inventory is up-to-date and includes approval dates for all listed assets.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No procedure exists for identifying/removing assets without approval dates.\n- The procedure is incomplete, not implemented, or not followed.\n- Asset inventory is missing, outdated, or lacks approval dates.\n- Evidence shows assets without approval dates are still in use.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Procedure exists but is inconsistently applied or only covers some asset types.\n- Asset inventory is mostly complete but has minor gaps (e.g., a few assets missing approval dates, with a plan to address).\n- Evidence is insufficient or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedure or policy for asset disposal/removal.\n- Asset inventory (hardware and software) showing approval dates.\n- Records/logs of recent asset removals due to missing approval dates.\n- Screenshots, disposal certificates, or decommissioning logs.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Procedures should be clear, actionable, and tailored to the organization.\n- Asset inventory should be complete, with approval dates visible for each asset.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Generic or template procedures not adapted to the organization.\n- Inventories missing approval dates or with many “unknown” entries.\n- No evidence of actual asset removal activities.\n- Evidence appears fabricated, outdated, or inconsistent with responses.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question:  \n**IT: What is the current procedure to dispose of physical and software assets without approval dates?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Existence of a documented, communicated procedure.\n- Steps for identifying assets lacking approval dates.\n- Defined process for removing/decommissioning such assets.\n- Assignment of responsibility (who performs the checks/removal).\n- Evidence of recent application of the procedure.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “We maintain an asset inventory with approval dates. Assets found without approval dates during quarterly reviews are flagged and removed within 2 weeks. Disposal is logged and reviewed by IT.”\n- “Our IT policy requires all new hardware/software to be approved and dated. Any asset found without an approval date is immediately scheduled for removal, and this is documented in our asset management system.”\n- Supporting evidence: Asset inventory with approval dates, removal logs, screenshots of decommissioned assets.\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We don’t have a formal procedure, but we try to keep track.”\n- “We haven’t found any assets without approval dates, so we haven’t needed a procedure.”\n- “We only check hardware, not software.”\n- No supporting evidence or only verbal assurances.\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide a copy of your asset disposal/removal procedure?”\n- “Show a recent example where an asset was removed due to missing approval date.”\n- “How often do you review your asset inventory for missing approval dates?”\n- “Who is responsible for this process?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet inventory and a basic written procedure are acceptable.\n- The process can be manual but must be documented and followed.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means a periodic (e.g., quarterly or annual) review of assets, not continuous monitoring.\n- Use of simple tools (spreadsheets, checklists) is acceptable.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with specialized hardware/software (e.g., medical, industrial) may have longer asset lifecycles but must still track approval dates.\n- Cloud/SaaS-heavy organizations must include virtual/software assets.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Asset inventories exist but lack approval dates.\n- Procedures are written but not implemented.\n- Only hardware or only software is covered.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated inventories.\n- No evidence of actual asset removal.\n- Procedures copied from templates without customization.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating “all assets have approval dates” without evidence.\n- Listing a procedure but never applying it.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented procedure for removing assets without approval dates?**\n   - No → FAIL\n   - Yes → Proceed\n\n2. **Is the procedure implemented and evidenced (recent removals, up-to-date inventory)?**\n   - No → FAIL\n   - Yes → Proceed\n\n3. **Does the asset inventory include approval dates for all assets?**\n   - No → Partial Compliance (request remediation plan or further evidence)\n   - Yes → PASS\n\n4. **Is the evidence credible, current, and organization-specific?**\n   - No → FAIL or escalate for review\n   - Yes → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If the organization claims all assets are approved but cannot show inventory or removal records, escalate.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scale (e.g., spreadsheet vs. asset management tool).\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, implemented procedure for removing hardware/software assets without approval dates, supported by up-to-date inventories and evidence of recent removals. Responses lacking documentation, implementation, or credible evidence should result in a FAIL or require further investigation. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement: unapproved assets must not remain in use.",

Provision Overview\n\n**Practical Requirement:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that, prior to disposing of any hardware asset (e.g., computers, servers, external drives, mobile devices), all confidential information is securely deleted. This can be achieved through methods such as encrypting the hard disk before reformatting, overwriting data, or using secure wipe tools.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data after hardware leaves the organization’s control.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches resulting from improper disposal of IT equipment.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nDisposing of hardware without securely deleting data exposes organizations to data leakage and potential regulatory violations. This provision ensures that even resource-constrained organizations take basic, effective steps to protect data at end-of-life for hardware assets.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a documented and consistently applied process for securely deleting all confidential information from hardware before disposal.\n- The process includes at least one recognized secure deletion method (e.g., disk encryption prior to reformatting, overwriting, use of secure erase tools).\n- Staff responsible for hardware disposal are aware of and follow this process.\n- Evidence (e.g., policy, procedure, disposal records) supports that the process is in use.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process exists for secure deletion of data prior to hardware disposal.\n- The process is ad hoc, informal, or not documented.\n- Only basic deletion (e.g., file deletion or standard formatting without encryption/overwriting) is performed.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization has a process, but it is inconsistently applied or only covers some hardware types.\n- The process relies on less secure methods (e.g., standard formatting) but shows intent to improve.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers recent disposals.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written policy or procedure describing secure data deletion before hardware disposal.\n- Records or logs of recent hardware disposals showing secure deletion steps.\n- Screenshots or photos of secure erase tools in use (if available).\n- Staff training materials or communications about the process.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months) and relevant to the organization’s actual hardware assets.\n- Documentation should clearly describe the secure deletion method(s) used.\n- Disposal records should indicate which assets were securely wiped and by whom.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, copied from the internet, or not tailored to the organization.\n- No mention of encryption, overwriting, or secure erase tools.\n- Only “delete files” or “format drive” is referenced.\n- No proof of staff awareness or training.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear description of the secure deletion process for hardware disposal.\n- Mention of specific tools or methods (e.g., BitLocker encryption, DBAN, built-in secure erase).\n- Evidence that the process is followed (e.g., disposal logs, screenshots, staff attestations).\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Before disposing of laptops, we use [Tool Name] to securely wipe the hard drive, and keep a record in our asset disposal log.”\n- “All computers are encrypted with BitLocker. Before disposal, we reformat and overwrite the drive using [Tool/Method].”\n- “Our IT policy requires secure deletion before disposal. Attached is our procedure and a recent disposal record.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We just delete files before giving away old computers.”\n- “We format the drives, but do not use any special tools.”\n- “We don’t have a process for this.”\n- “We haven’t disposed of any hardware recently, so we don’t need a process.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide a copy of your secure deletion procedure?”\n- “What tool or method do you use to ensure data is unrecoverable?”\n- “Who is responsible for carrying out secure deletion?”\n- “Can you show a recent example of a hardware disposal record?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple written procedure and basic use of free secure erase tools is acceptable.\n- If only a few devices are disposed of per year, evidence can be limited to those instances.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or built-in tools (e.g., Windows BitLocker, macOS Disk Utility, DBAN) are acceptable.\n- Manual logs or checklists are sufficient if formal asset management systems are not in place.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations handling sensitive personal or financial data may require stricter controls.\n- For sectors with regulatory requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance), ensure the process meets minimum legal standards.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Confusing file deletion or formatting with secure deletion.\n- No process for mobile devices or external storage.\n- Lack of staff awareness or training.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated or generic policies not reflecting current practice.\n- No evidence of actual disposals or secure deletion being performed.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policies that mention secure deletion but no evidence of implementation.\n- Responses that claim “all data is deleted” without describing the method.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented process for secure deletion before hardware disposal?**\n   - If YES, proceed to 2.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n2. **Does the process use recognized secure deletion methods (encryption, overwriting, secure erase tools)?**\n   - If YES, proceed to 3.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n3. **Is there evidence that the process is followed (e.g., disposal records, staff awareness)?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL depending on context.\n\n4. **Is the evidence recent and relevant?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and resources.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in partial or borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, practical process for secure deletion of data before hardware disposal, evidence that the process is followed, and use of recognized secure deletion methods. Responses lacking these elements should be marked as FAIL, with partial credit only if there is clear intent and partial implementation. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept “delete files” or “format only” as sufficient.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that when hardware (especially those containing data, such as hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, and other storage media) is no longer needed, it is disposed of in a way that data cannot be recovered. This typically involves physical destruction (e.g., shredding, degaussing, crushing) or using a reputable third-party disposal service that provides secure destruction and certification.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized recovery of sensitive or confidential data from disposed hardware.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches due to improper disposal.\n- Demonstrate accountability and due diligence in asset lifecycle management.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nImproper disposal of IT assets is a common source of data leaks. Even small organizations may hold sensitive information (e.g., customer data, business records) on old devices. Secure disposal is a baseline control to prevent data from falling into the wrong hands.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization describes a clear, repeatable process for secure disposal of hardware containing data.\n- The process includes physical destruction (e.g., shredding, crushing) or use of a reputable third-party service.\n- There is evidence that the process has been followed for at least one recent disposal event (if applicable).\n- If no disposals have occurred recently, the organization can describe the intended process and name a vendor or method.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process is described, or the process is inadequate (e.g., simply throwing devices in the trash, donating without wiping/destroying).\n- No evidence of secure disposal is provided when disposals have occurred.\n- The organization is unaware of the need for secure disposal or has not considered it.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization describes a process but lacks evidence of implementation (e.g., no recent disposals).\n- The process is informal or ad hoc, but shows awareness and intent to improve.\n- The organization wipes devices but does not physically destroy or use a certified service (borderline—requires further probing).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Disposal records/logs (even simple spreadsheets or emails).\n- Certificates of destruction from third-party vendors.\n- Photos of physical destruction (if done in-house).\n- Written procedures or policies describing the disposal process.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12–24 months, if disposals occurred).\n- Certificates should include organization name, date, and details of destroyed assets.\n- Photos should clearly show destruction of relevant devices.\n- Written procedures should be clear and actionable.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague statements with no supporting documentation.\n- Certificates or photos that appear generic, reused, or unrelated to the organization.\n- Descriptions that suggest devices are reused, sold, or donated without secure erasure or destruction.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- A clear description of the disposal process for hardware containing data.\n- Mention of physical destruction or use of a certified third-party service.\n- Evidence that the process has been followed (if disposals have occurred).\n- Awareness of the need for secure disposal, even if no disposals have yet occurred.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We use [Vendor Name] for secure disposal and receive certificates of destruction for all hard drives. See attached certificate dated [date].”\n- “We physically destroy old hard drives using a hammer and document the process with photos. See attached photos and disposal log.”\n- “No disposals have occurred in the last year, but our policy is to use [Vendor Name] for secure shredding. See attached policy document.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We throw old computers in the bin.”\n- “We donate old laptops to charity without wiping them.”\n- “We don’t have a process for disposal.”\n- “We just delete files before disposal.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide a sample certificate of destruction or disposal log?”\n- “How do you ensure that all data is irrecoverable before donating or disposing of devices?”\n- “Who is responsible for overseeing the disposal process?”\n- “If you have not disposed of any devices recently, what is your planned process?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple documented process (e.g., physically destroying drives with a hammer and keeping a photo log) is acceptable.\n- Use of third-party vendors is not mandatory if in-house destruction is effective and documented.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means a process that is practical for the organization’s size and resources, but must ensure data is not recoverable.\n- Lack of recent disposals is not a fail if a clear process exists for future disposals.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should show extra diligence.\n- For sectors with regulatory requirements, reference to those standards is a positive indicator.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming deleting files or formatting drives is sufficient.\n- No documentation of disposal events.\n- Relying on informal or verbal processes.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Missing or outdated certificates/logs.\n- Photos that do not clearly show destruction.\n- Policies that are generic or not tailored to the organization.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating “we use a vendor” without naming the vendor or providing evidence.\n- Claiming “we destroy drives” with no supporting documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Has the organization described a secure disposal process?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Is there evidence of implementation (if disposals have occurred)?**\n   - **No** (but no disposals have occurred) → Check if process is clear and actionable → PASS if yes, otherwise FAIL\n   - **No** (disposals have occurred) → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Does the process ensure data is irrecoverable (physical destruction or certified service)?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If the process is described but not documented, request additional evidence or clarification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and process clarity across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, practical, and documented process for secure hardware disposal, with supporting evidence where applicable. The process must ensure data is irrecoverable, either through physical destruction or use of a reputable third-party service. Responses lacking detail, evidence, or demonstrating unsafe practices should result in a FAIL.

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.3.4a  \n**Clause: Assets: Data – Know what data the organisation has, where they are, and secure the data**  \n**Provision Requirement:** The organisation shall identify and maintain an inventory of business-critical data, including description, classification/sensitivity, location, and retention period.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must maintain a current inventory of all business-critical data. This inventory must include, at minimum:\n- A description of each data set or type\n- Its classification or sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential)\n- Where the data is stored (location: physical or digital)\n- The retention period for each data set\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Ensure the organization knows what critical data it holds and where it resides\n- Enable appropriate protection and compliance with legal/regulatory requirements\n- Support effective data management, risk assessment, and incident response\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nWithout a clear understanding of what data exists, where it is, and its sensitivity, organizations cannot adequately protect their information assets. This is foundational for all other security controls and for compliance with regulations such as PDPA.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides a data inventory (e.g., spreadsheet, table, or asset management tool output) listing all business-critical data.\n- For each data entry, the following are clearly documented:\n    - Description of the data (e.g., \"Customer contact details\", \"Payroll records\")\n    - Data classification/sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential)\n    - Location (e.g., \"HR shared drive\", \"Cloud storage: Google Drive\", \"Physical file cabinet in HQ\")\n    - Retention period (e.g., \"7 years\", \"Until contract termination\", \"Indefinite\")\n- The inventory is up-to-date (reviewed/updated within the last 12 months).\n- The inventory covers all critical business functions and data types relevant to the organization’s operations.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No data inventory is provided, or the inventory is missing entirely.\n- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only lists some data, or omits key fields such as classification or retention).\n- The inventory is outdated (not reviewed/updated in the last 12 months).\n- Responses are vague, generic, or do not demonstrate knowledge of what data is held or where it is stored.\n- No evidence is provided to support claims.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The inventory is present but missing one or more required fields (e.g., retention period not specified).\n- The inventory covers only some business-critical data, or only some departments/functions.\n- Evidence is provided but is not fully up-to-date or lacks clarity.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Data inventory document (spreadsheet, table, or export from asset management tool)\n- Screenshots of inventory if tool-based\n- Policy or procedure documents referencing data inventory maintenance\n- Evidence of recent review/update (e.g., date last updated, version history)\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be specific to the organization (not a generic template)\n- All required fields (description, classification, location, retention) must be present for each data entry\n- Inventory should be readable, logically organized, and cover all critical data\n- Evidence should be dated within the last 12 months\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory is a blank template or contains placeholder text\n- Inventory is missing key fields or is incomplete\n- Evidence is undated or clearly outdated\n- Inventory lists only IT assets (e.g., servers, laptops) but not data types\n- Contradictions between inventory and self-assessment responses\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of business-critical data types (not just generic categories)\n- Explicit data classification (e.g., \"Confidential\", \"Internal\", \"Public\")\n- Specific storage locations (not just \"on the server\" or \"in the cloud\")\n- Defined retention periods for each data type\n- Evidence that the inventory is maintained and reviewed\n\n### Acceptable Responses & Evidence\n- \"We maintain a spreadsheet listing all customer, employee, and financial data. Each entry includes a description, classification (Confidential/Internal), storage location (e.g., Google Drive, HR folder), and retention period (e.g., 7 years for payroll). Last updated: March 2024. [Spreadsheet attached]\"\n- \"Our asset management tool tracks all business data sets, with fields for sensitivity, location, and retention. Screenshot attached showing sample entries.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We know what data we have, but do not keep a formal inventory.\"\n- \"All our data is in the cloud.\"\n- \"We keep data as long as needed.\"\n- \"See attached template\" (with no actual data filled in)\n- \"We follow PDPA\" (without evidence of inventory)\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide a sample of your data inventory?\n- When was the inventory last reviewed or updated?\n- How do you determine data classification and retention periods?\n- Are all business-critical data types included (e.g., HR, customer, financial)?\n- How do you ensure the inventory stays current?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet or table is acceptable.\n- Inventory may be brief but must still cover all critical data types and required fields.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual inventories are acceptable; sophisticated tools are not required.\n- Reasonable effort means the inventory is maintained and reviewed at least annually.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more detailed inventories.\n- Consider sector-specific data types (e.g., patient records, financial statements).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Inventory lists only IT assets, not data types\n- Missing retention periods or data classification\n- Inventory is not maintained or reviewed regularly\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is a template, not an actual inventory\n- Inventory is outdated or incomplete\n- No supporting evidence provided\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that claim compliance but provide no evidence\n- Inventories that list only a few data types, omitting others\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is a data inventory provided?**\n    - No → FAIL\n    - Yes → Proceed\n\n2. **Does the inventory include all required fields (description, classification, location, retention)?**\n    - No → Partial Compliance (request clarification/evidence)\n    - Yes → Proceed\n\n3. **Is the inventory up-to-date (reviewed/updated within 12 months)?**\n    - No → Partial Compliance (request update)\n    - Yes → Proceed\n\n4. **Does the inventory cover all business-critical data?**\n    - No → Partial Compliance (request clarification)\n    - Yes → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims not to have any business-critical data, escalate for review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must provide a current, complete inventory of business-critical data, including description, classification, location, and retention period. Evidence must be specific, up-to-date, and cover all critical data types. Partial or missing information requires follow-up. No inventory or inadequate evidence results in FAIL. Adjust expectations for small organizations, but all must demonstrate basic data awareness and management.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must maintain an up-to-date inventory of the data they hold, including what data exists and where it is stored. Critically, this inventory must be reviewed at least once per year, and also whenever there is a change to the data captured (e.g., new data types collected, data deleted, or storage locations changed).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure the organization is always aware of its data assets and their locations.\n- Enable timely identification and protection of sensitive or critical data.\n- Reduce the risk of data loss, unauthorized access, or regulatory non-compliance due to unknown or unmanaged data.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nRegular review of the data inventory is essential for maintaining visibility over organizational data, especially as business processes and data flows change. This is a foundational step for effective data protection and incident response.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization reviews its data inventory **at least once every 12 months**.\n- The organization reviews the inventory **whenever there is a change** to the data captured (e.g., new data types, new storage locations, data deletions).\n- The review process is **documented** (e.g., review logs, meeting notes, updated inventory lists with timestamps).\n- The organization can **demonstrate awareness** of this requirement and provide evidence of recent reviews.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The inventory is **not reviewed annually** (i.e., last review was over 12 months ago).\n- The organization **cannot demonstrate** that reviews occur when data changes.\n- There is **no documentation** or evidence of review activities.\n- The organization is **unaware** of the need for periodic or change-driven reviews.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization reviews the inventory **less frequently than annually** (e.g., every 18 months).\n- Reviews are conducted **ad hoc** but not systematically when data changes.\n- Evidence is **incomplete** (e.g., only verbal confirmation, no supporting documentation).\n- The process is **informal** or lacks clear records.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Inventory review logs** (manual or digital, showing review dates).\n- **Meeting minutes** or emails referencing inventory reviews.\n- **Updated inventory lists** with modification/review timestamps.\n- **Change management records** indicating inventory updates after data changes.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **dated** and **traceable** to specific review events.\n- Evidence should **clearly indicate** both periodic (annual) and event-driven (upon data change) reviews.\n- Documentation should be **recent** (within the last 12 months) and **consistent** with the organization's stated review frequency.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is **undated** or lacks clear indication of review frequency.\n- Inventory lists are **outdated** or have not been updated in over a year.\n- Only **verbal assurances** or generic statements are provided.\n- Evidence appears **fabricated** (e.g., identical review dates for multiple years, inconsistent details).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question: \"How often is the inventory list being reviewed?\"\n\n#### What to Look For\n- A **clear statement** of review frequency (e.g., \"annually,\" \"every 6 months,\" \"after any data change\").\n- **Description of triggers** for ad hoc reviews (e.g., \"whenever new data is collected or deleted\").\n- **Supporting evidence** as outlined above.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We review our data inventory every 12 months and whenever there is a change in the data we collect or store. The last review was conducted on [date], and we updated the inventory when we started using a new cloud service in [month/year]. See attached review log and updated inventory list.\"\n- \"Inventory reviews are scheduled annually in our IT calendar, and we also update the list when onboarding new systems. Attached are meeting notes from the last review and the updated inventory file.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We review the inventory when we remember to.\"\n- \"We haven't reviewed the inventory in over a year.\"\n- \"We don't keep a record of reviews.\"\n- \"We only update the inventory when there is a major change, but not on a regular basis.\"\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide documentation or logs showing the last two inventory reviews?\"\n- \"How do you ensure the inventory is updated when new data is collected or deleted?\"\n- \"Who is responsible for conducting and recording inventory reviews?\"\n- \"What triggers an ad hoc review outside the annual schedule?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For **very small organizations** (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or checklist with review dates is acceptable.\n- The process can be **manual** but must be **consistent** and **documented**.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- \"Reasonable effort\" means a **basic, repeatable process** (e.g., annual calendar reminder, simple log).\n- No need for complex tools; **clarity and regularity** are key.\n\n### Industry Context\n- **Highly regulated sectors** (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more frequent or detailed reviews.\n- For organizations with **minimal data assets**, the inventory and review process can be proportionately simple but must still meet the annual and change-driven review requirement.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Reviews are **claimed** but not **documented**.\n- Inventory is **updated only when convenient**, not systematically.\n- **No process** for reviewing after data changes.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- **Missing or outdated** review logs.\n- **No evidence** of ad hoc reviews after data changes.\n- **Generic statements** without specifics.\n\n### False Positives\n- Inventory list is **current** but **no evidence** of regular review.\n- **Template documents** with no real activity behind them.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence of an inventory review within the last 12 months?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Is there evidence that the inventory is reviewed/updated when data changes?**\n   - **No** → FAIL or Partial Compliance (if annual review is strong)\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is the evidence credible, dated, and traceable?**\n   - **No** → FAIL or Partial Compliance\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is **ambiguous, incomplete, or appears fabricated**, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional supporting documentation.\n- If the organization claims compliance but **cannot provide any documentation**, escalate for further review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same **minimum evidence requirements** (dated review, evidence of change-driven updates) across all organizations.\n- For similar organization sizes and sectors, ensure **uniform expectations** for what constitutes sufficient documentation and process rigor.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must provide clear, dated evidence of at least annual inventory reviews and demonstrate that reviews/updates occur when data changes. The process can be simple but must be documented and repeatable. Lack of documentation, infrequent reviews, or only ad hoc updates without a systematic process should result in a FAIL or, at best, Partial Compliance pending further evidence.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must have a process in place to protect its business-critical data. This includes applying practical security measures such as password-protecting documents, encrypting personal data (especially at rest), and/or securing emails containing sensitive information.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive or business-critical data.\n- Reduce the risk of data breaches or leaks, especially for personal or confidential information.\n- Ensure that, even if data is lost or stolen, it remains protected and unreadable to unauthorized parties.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nData is a prime target for cyberattacks. Many breaches occur due to unprotected files or emails. Simple, practical controls like password protection and encryption are effective, affordable, and essential for organizations with limited resources. This provision ensures that organizations take basic but critical steps to secure their most valuable information.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization demonstrates that it has identified its business-critical data.\n- There is a clear, implemented process for protecting such data (e.g., password protection, encryption at rest, secure email practices).\n- The process is applied consistently to all relevant data types.\n- Evidence (e.g., screenshots, policy documents, configuration settings) supports the claims.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No process exists, or the process is only informal/verbal with no supporting evidence.\n- Critical data is not protected by any means (no password protection, no encryption, no secure email).\n- The organization is unaware of what constitutes business-critical data or where it is stored.\n- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or clearly fabricated.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- Some, but not all, critical data is protected.\n- The process is ad hoc or inconsistently applied.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of data.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing controls but has not completed them.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Data protection policy or procedure documents.\n- Screenshots showing password protection or encryption settings on files/folders.\n- Examples of encrypted emails or secure email settings.\n- Lists or inventories of business-critical data and their protection status.\n- Training materials or communications to staff about data protection practices.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Should directly relate to the organization’s actual data and systems.\n- Screenshots should show real configurations, not generic templates.\n- Policies should be specific, not generic or copied from the internet.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not organization-specific.\n- Screenshots are stock images or do not match the described environment.\n- Policies are vague, lack implementation details, or are not followed in practice.\n- No evidence provided, or evidence is irrelevant to the provision.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Clear identification of what data is considered business-critical.\n- Description of how such data is protected (e.g., password protection, encryption).\n- Evidence that these measures are actually in use (not just planned or theoretical).\n- Consistency between the self-assessment answer and the supporting evidence.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “We maintain a list of business-critical files, which are stored in a password-protected folder on our server. Sensitive documents are encrypted using [tool], and all emails containing personal data are sent using [secure email solution]. See attached screenshots and policy.”\n- “All HR and finance documents are encrypted at rest using BitLocker. Staff are trained to password-protect sensitive PDFs before sharing. See attached training slides and screenshots.”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “We try to keep important files safe.”\n- “We don’t have any critical data.”\n- “We plan to implement encryption next year.”\n- “All our data is in the cloud, so it’s safe.” (without further details)\n- No evidence provided, or evidence does not match the described process.\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- What types of data do you consider business-critical?\n- How do you ensure all such data is protected (e.g., is there a checklist or automated process)?\n- Can you provide a recent example of a protected document or encrypted email?\n- How do you train staff to apply these measures?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations, a simple documented process (e.g., a one-page policy and a few screenshots) is acceptable.\n- The expectation is not enterprise-grade encryption, but practical, affordable controls (e.g., built-in OS encryption, password-protected files).\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Free or built-in tools (e.g., Windows BitLocker, password-protected PDFs, secure email settings) are acceptable.\n- Manual processes are acceptable if consistently applied and documented.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Organizations handling regulated data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may need to show stronger controls.\n- For organizations with minimal personal data, the focus should still be on any business-critical information (e.g., client lists, financials).\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Only some data is protected, or protection is inconsistent.\n- Staff are unaware of which data needs protection.\n- Reliance on cloud provider security without additional controls.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Policies are generic or not tailored to the organization.\n- Evidence is outdated or not linked to actual practices.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Descriptions of controls without evidence of actual use.\n- Overstating the effectiveness of cloud security without demonstrating configuration.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Is there a documented process for protecting business-critical data?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Is the process implemented and evidenced (e.g., screenshots, policies, examples)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Is the process applied to all relevant data?**\n   - If NO or only partially → Partial Compliance (request clarification or improvement)\n4. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**\n   - If NO → FAIL or Partial Compliance (depending on severity)\n5. **If all above are YES → PASS**\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If the organization claims not to have any business-critical data, escalate for review.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical, and consistently applied measures to protect business-critical data, supported by current and organization-specific evidence. Responses must go beyond intent or generic statements and demonstrate real, implemented controls appropriate to the organization’s size and resources.",

This includes technical controls (e.g., disabling USB ports, restricting file sharing, blocking cloud storage, email restrictions) and/or procedural controls (e.g., policies, user awareness, monitoring).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized transfer of sensitive data outside the organization.\n- Reduce risk of data loss, theft, or unintentional disclosure by employees.\n- Ensure that employees cannot easily bypass controls to exfiltrate data.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nData leakage is a common cause of security incidents, often resulting from accidental or deliberate actions by insiders. Simple, practical controls can significantly reduce this risk, especially in organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization has implemented at least one effective technical control to prevent data leakage (e.g., USB port disabling, file transfer restrictions, DLP software, email attachment controls).\n- OR, if technical controls are not feasible, strong procedural controls are in place (e.g., clear policies, regular staff training, monitoring, and enforcement).\n- The measures are appropriate to the organization’s size, resources, and risk profile.\n- Evidence supports that controls are active and enforced.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No measures are in place to prevent data leakage.\n- Only informal or verbal instructions are provided, with no technical or procedural enforcement.\n- Controls are described but not implemented (e.g., “We plan to disable USB ports”).\n- Evidence is missing, outdated, or not credible.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- Some controls exist but are incomplete (e.g., USB ports disabled on some but not all devices).\n- Reliance solely on user awareness without supporting technical or procedural controls.\n- Policies exist but are not communicated or enforced.\n- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine adequacy.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Screenshots of USB port control settings, group policy configurations, or endpoint management dashboards.\n- Copies of data handling or acceptable use policies.\n- Training records or awareness materials.\n- System logs or reports showing enforcement of controls.\n- Email or cloud storage restrictions documentation.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Should clearly demonstrate that controls are implemented and active.\n- Policies must be formally documented and communicated to staff.\n- Technical evidence should show organization-wide application, not just on a single device.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Evidence is generic, not organization-specific.\n- Screenshots or documents are outdated or incomplete.\n- Policies are draft or not approved.\n- No proof of communication or enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Clear description of technical and/or procedural measures to prevent data leakage.\n- Evidence that these measures are implemented and enforced.\n- Appropriateness of controls for the organization’s context.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “We have disabled USB ports on all company computers using group policy. See attached screenshot of our endpoint management console.”\n- “Employees cannot send emails with attachments to external addresses. Our email system blocks such attempts (see policy and system log excerpt).”\n- “We have a data handling policy that prohibits use of personal cloud storage. All staff have signed the policy and received training (see training attendance records).”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “We tell staff not to copy data to USB drives, but we don’t enforce it.”\n- “We plan to implement controls next quarter.”\n- “We trust our employees not to leak data.”\n- “No measures are in place, but we have never had an incident.”\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- How do you ensure that the controls are applied to all relevant devices/users?\n- How often are these controls reviewed or tested?\n- Can you provide a sample of the communication or training provided to staff?\n- Are there any exceptions to these controls, and how are they managed?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), procedural controls (e.g., signed policies, regular reminders) may be acceptable if technical controls are not feasible, but must be documented and enforced.\n- For larger organizations, technical controls are expected unless there is a justified reason.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Free or built-in controls (e.g., Windows group policy, basic email restrictions) are acceptable.\n- Expensive DLP solutions are not required, but reasonable effort to use available tools is expected.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Organizations handling highly sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should have stronger controls.\n- For sectors with less sensitive data, proportional controls are acceptable, but some measure must be in place.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Relying solely on trust or informal instructions.\n- Controls applied inconsistently across devices or users.\n- Outdated or uncommunicated policies.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Lack of evidence showing actual implementation.\n- Policies not signed or acknowledged by staff.\n- Screenshots or logs not showing organization-wide coverage.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Descriptions of planned controls without evidence of implementation.\n- Policies that exist but are not enforced or communicated.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Are there documented and enforced technical or procedural controls to prevent data leakage?**\n   - If YES, proceed to 2.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n2. **Is there credible, current evidence of implementation and enforcement?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (request more evidence).\n3. **Are controls appropriate for the organization’s size and risk?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL (depending on severity).\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If controls are partial, inconsistent, or evidence is unclear, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and risk profile.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical, and enforced measures—technical or procedural—to prevent employee data leakage, supported by credible evidence. Responses relying solely on trust, intention, or incomplete controls should not pass. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but require at least documented and enforced procedural controls. Always request further evidence or clarification if responses are unclear or incomplete.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that any paper-based media (e.g., printed documents, forms, reports) containing confidential or sensitive data are securely destroyed—specifically, by shredding—before disposal. This applies to all hard copy records that could expose sensitive information if discarded improperly.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive/confidential information after disposal.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches via physical document recovery from bins or recycling.\n- Demonstrate awareness and control over the lifecycle of sensitive data.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nPhysical documents are a common source of data leakage, especially in resource-constrained environments. Secure shredding is a simple, effective, and affordable control to prevent data compromise from discarded paper records.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a documented or clearly described procedure for securely disposing of hard copy media containing sensitive/confidential data.\n- The procedure explicitly requires shredding (using a shredder or secure shredding service) before disposal.\n- There is evidence that shredders are available and used, or that a reputable shredding service is engaged.\n- Staff are aware of and follow the procedure.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No procedure exists, or the procedure does not address secure shredding of sensitive/confidential documents.\n- The organization disposes of sensitive/confidential paper records in regular bins or recycling without shredding.\n- No shredder is available, and no secure shredding service is used.\n- Responses are vague, generic, or indicate ad-hoc/uncontrolled disposal.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Procedure exists but is informal (e.g., verbal instructions only), or only some sensitive documents are shredded.\n- Shredder is available but not consistently used, or only certain staff are aware of the requirement.\n- The organization outsources shredding but cannot provide details or evidence of the service.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedure or policy (even if brief or informal) describing shredding of sensitive/confidential documents.\n- Photographs of shredders in use, purchase receipts, or maintenance logs.\n- Service agreements or invoices from secure shredding providers.\n- Staff communications or training materials referencing shredding requirements.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Procedures should be specific to sensitive/confidential data, not just general waste.\n- If using a service, provider should be reputable and service should be periodic.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to sensitive/confidential data.\n- No proof of shredder/service, or only verbal assurances.\n- Documents referencing shredding but no supporting artifacts.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**\"Do you have a procedure to dispose of hard copy media? Any paper shredders?\"**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Clear description of a process for identifying and shredding sensitive/confidential documents.\n- Existence and use of a shredder or secure shredding service.\n- Evidence that staff are aware of and follow the process.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We have a shredder in the office. All documents containing customer or business-sensitive information are shredded before disposal. Staff are instructed to use the shredder for such documents.\"\n- \"We use [Company Name] secure shredding service monthly for all confidential paperwork. Service agreement attached.\"\n- \"Our office policy (attached) requires all sensitive documents to be shredded. Shredder purchase receipt attached.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We throw away old papers in the bin.\"\n- \"We recycle all documents, including sensitive ones.\"\n- \"We don’t have a shredder, but we tear up papers by hand.\"\n- \"No formal process, staff use their own judgment.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide a copy of the written procedure or staff instructions?\"\n- \"Can you show evidence of the shredder or shredding service?\"\n- \"How do you ensure all staff follow the shredding requirement?\"\n- \"How do you identify which documents are considered sensitive/confidential?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple, clearly communicated process and a basic shredder are sufficient.\n- Written procedures can be brief (e.g., a one-page memo or email).\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- A low-cost shredder is acceptable; industrial shredders or expensive services are not required.\n- Outsourcing to a secure shredding provider is acceptable if cost-effective.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations in sectors handling large volumes of sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more robust controls.\n- For organizations with minimal paper records, a simple process and occasional shredding may suffice.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming general waste disposal is sufficient.\n- Only shredding some documents, not all sensitive/confidential ones.\n- No process for staff to identify sensitive documents.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- No written evidence of procedure or staff instructions.\n- Outdated or irrelevant evidence (e.g., old purchase receipts with no current shredder).\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating a shredder exists but providing no evidence of use or staff awareness.\n- Claiming to use a shredding service but unable to provide service records.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a procedure (written or clearly described) for shredding sensitive/confidential paper documents before disposal?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Next\n\n2. **Is there evidence of a shredder or secure shredding service in use?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Next\n\n3. **Is the procedure communicated to and followed by staff?**\n   - **No/Unclear** → Partial Compliance (request clarification)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence, escalate to senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scale (e.g., micro-businesses may have simpler documentation).\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, practical process for shredding sensitive/confidential paper documents, evidence of a shredder or secure shredding service, and indications that staff are aware of and follow the process. Responses lacking these elements should be marked as FAIL, with partial compliance flagged for further investigation. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement: sensitive/confidential paper records must be securely shredded before disposal.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must have anti-malware solutions installed and actively used on all endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops, servers, virtual environments) to detect and prevent malicious software attacks.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent, detect, and respond to malware threats (viruses, ransomware, spyware, etc.)\n- Ensure all endpoints are protected, minimizing the risk of compromise\n- Maintain a baseline of security hygiene across the organization\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nMalware is a leading cause of data breaches and operational disruption. Resource-constrained organizations are frequent targets due to perceived weaker defenses. This provision ensures that basic, effective anti-malware controls are in place, forming a critical first line of defense.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Anti-malware software is installed and active on all endpoints** (laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines).\n- **The solution is up-to-date** (receives regular signature/definition updates).\n- **Coverage is organization-wide** (no significant gaps in deployment).\n- **Staff responsible for management are identified** (even if outsourced).\n- **Evidence of recent scans or detections** (e.g., scan logs, screenshots, reports).\n- **If EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) or similar advanced controls are used, their anti-malware capabilities are clearly described.**\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- **No anti-malware solution is in place** on one or more endpoints.\n- **Anti-malware is outdated, disabled, or not centrally managed.**\n- **No evidence of deployment or operation** (e.g., no logs, screenshots, or reports).\n- **Significant endpoint types are unprotected** (e.g., servers, remote laptops).\n- **Responses are vague or generic** (e.g., “We have antivirus” with no specifics).\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- **Some endpoints are protected, but not all** (e.g., desktops covered, but servers or remote laptops are not).\n- **Anti-malware is installed but not regularly updated or monitored.**\n- **Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of the environment.**\n- **Unclear who is responsible for management.**\n- **In these cases, request clarification or additional evidence.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Screenshots** of anti-malware software installed on endpoints (showing product name, update status, scan results).\n- **Inventory lists** indicating anti-malware deployment status.\n- **Scan logs or reports** (recent, within the last month).\n- **Policy documents** (if available) describing anti-malware requirements.\n- **Service provider contracts** (if anti-malware is managed externally).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- **Evidence must be recent** (within the last 1-2 months).\n- **Screenshots/logs must clearly show endpoint names and anti-malware status.**\n- **Evidence should cover a representative sample of all endpoint types.**\n- **If using managed services, documentation should specify anti-malware coverage.**\n\n### Red Flags\n- **Screenshots or logs are outdated or undated.**\n- **Evidence only covers a single device or is not representative.**\n- **Product names are missing or unclear.**\n- **Evidence appears generic, templated, or not organization-specific.**\n- **No evidence provided, or only policy statements without proof of implementation.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: \"Any vulnerability-assessment (VA) scans conducted? Can you share frequency and remediation details, and who manages this?\"\n- **What to Look For:**  \n  - Mention of anti-malware scans as part of VA process.\n  - Frequency of scans (e.g., daily, weekly).\n  - Identification of responsible staff or service provider.\n  - Evidence of scan results and remediation actions.\n\n- **Acceptable Responses:**  \n  - “We run weekly anti-malware scans on all endpoints using [Product Name]. IT Manager reviews results and remediates as needed. See attached scan logs.”\n  - “Our managed service provider runs daily scans and provides monthly reports. See attached sample report.”\n\n- **Unacceptable Responses:**  \n  - “We do scans sometimes.” (No details or evidence)\n  - “Not sure who manages this.”\n  - “We rely on Windows Defender but have no logs.”\n\n- **Follow-up Questions:**  \n  - “Can you provide screenshots or logs from recent scans?”\n  - “Are all endpoint types included in these scans?”\n  - “Who is responsible for ensuring anti-malware is up-to-date?”\n\n### Q2: \"Are there any security controls (e.g., EDR) installed on machines?\"\n- **What to Look For:**  \n  - Specific mention of anti-malware or EDR products.\n  - Confirmation of deployment across all endpoints.\n  - Evidence of installation and operation.\n\n- **Acceptable Responses:**  \n  - “All endpoints have [Product Name] anti-malware installed and updated automatically.”\n  - “We use [EDR Product] which includes anti-malware features. See attached deployment report.”\n\n- **Unacceptable Responses:**  \n  - “We have some antivirus, but not sure where.”\n  - “Only some computers have protection.”\n  - “No security controls installed.”\n\n- **Follow-up Questions:**  \n  - “Can you provide a list of protected endpoints?”\n  - “How do you ensure new devices are protected?”\n  - “How do you monitor anti-malware status?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- **Very small organizations (≤10 staff):**  \n  - May use built-in solutions (e.g., Windows Defender) if enabled and updated.\n  - Evidence can be limited to a sample of all devices.\n- **Larger organizations:**  \n  - Expect more formalized deployment and monitoring.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- **Reasonable effort:**  \n  - Use of free or built-in anti-malware is acceptable if properly configured and maintained.\n  - Manual checks are acceptable if no central management.\n\n### Industry Context\n- **Sectors with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance):**  \n  - May require more robust solutions or monitoring.\n- **Remote/hybrid work:**  \n  - Ensure remote endpoints are also covered.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only office-based devices protected; remote or BYOD devices unprotected.\n- Anti-malware installed but not updated or monitored.\n- No clear responsibility for anti-malware management.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated or incomplete evidence.\n- Evidence not linked to the organization (e.g., stock images).\n- No proof of coverage for all endpoint types.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy documents without operational evidence.\n- Screenshots from a single device presented as evidence for all.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is anti-malware installed and active on all endpoints?**\n   - If YES, proceed.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the anti-malware solution up-to-date and regularly used?**\n   - If YES, proceed.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n3. **Is there credible, recent evidence of deployment and operation?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, request more evidence or mark as PARTIAL.\n\n4. **Are all endpoint types covered (including remote/virtual)?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL depending on risk.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or contradictory, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.\n- If organization claims full coverage but cannot provide evidence, escalate.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and context.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in partial or borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and representative evidence that anti-malware solutions are installed, active, and updated on all endpoints. Responses must specify coverage, management responsibility, and provide proof of operation. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept vague or unsupported claims. Escalate unclear cases and ensure consistent application of criteria.",

Where feasible, scans should always be automated and remain active to provide constant protection.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must have measures in place to detect and prevent malicious software (malware, viruses, ransomware, etc.) on all IT assets. This includes running regular virus/malware scans, ideally automated and with real-time protection enabled, to provide ongoing defense against cyber threats.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Early detection and removal of malware before it can cause harm  \n- Continuous protection through automated, active scanning  \n- Minimizing risk of infection and spread within the organization\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nMalware is a leading cause of data breaches and operational disruption. Automated, active scanning is a fundamental, low-effort, high-impact control that prevents common attacks. For resource-constrained organizations, using built-in or reputable free anti-malware solutions is acceptable if properly configured and maintained.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has anti-malware software installed on all relevant devices (servers, desktops, laptops, and, where feasible, mobile devices).\n- Virus/malware scans are performed regularly (at least weekly), and real-time/active protection is enabled where possible.\n- Scans are automated (scheduled or real-time) rather than solely manual.\n- The solution is up-to-date and supported (not end-of-life).\n- The organization can provide evidence of scans being performed (e.g., logs, screenshots, settings).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No anti-malware solution is in place, or only some devices are protected.\n- Scans are performed only manually and infrequently (less than monthly).\n- Real-time/active protection is not enabled and no justification is provided.\n- The anti-malware solution is outdated, unsupported, or expired.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Anti-malware is installed but only on some devices (e.g., only on desktops, not laptops).\n- Scans are performed but not automated or not frequent enough.\n- Real-time protection is not enabled due to technical constraints, but compensating controls are described.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of anti-malware software installed and running on devices\n- Configuration screenshots showing scheduled scans and real-time protection enabled\n- Scan logs or reports showing recent scan activity\n- Asset inventory showing coverage of anti-malware deployment\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months)\n- Screenshots/logs must clearly show device names, dates, and status\n- Evidence must be consistent with the organization's asset inventory\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic (e.g., stock images, vendor marketing screenshots)\n- Evidence is outdated or shows last scan was months ago\n- Evidence only covers a subset of devices without explanation\n- No evidence provided, or evidence is unverifiable\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question: \"Any anti-malware solutions in place?\"\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of anti-malware solution(s) used (e.g., Windows Defender, Avast, Sophos)\n- Confirmation that the solution is installed on all relevant devices\n- Description of scan frequency and whether scans are automated/real-time\n- Supporting evidence as described above\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We use Windows Defender on all company laptops and desktops. Real-time protection is enabled, and weekly scans are scheduled automatically. See attached screenshots of settings and recent scan logs.\"\n- \"All devices have Avast Free Antivirus installed with real-time protection. Monthly scan reports are attached.\"\n- \"We use Sophos Endpoint Protection, managed centrally. All endpoints are covered, and daily scans are scheduled. See management console screenshot.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We ask staff to run scans when they remember.\"\n- \"Only our main office PC has antivirus; laptops do not.\"\n- \"We used to have antivirus, but it expired.\"\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide screenshots or logs showing recent scans on all devices?\"\n- \"Is real-time protection enabled?

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4c  \n**(Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Auto-updating anti-malware signatures)**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that their anti-malware solutions (e.g., antivirus software, endpoint protection) are configured to automatically update their malware signature files or equivalent detection mechanisms (such as machine learning models) at least daily, or as frequently as possible. This ensures the solution can detect and respond to the latest threats.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Maintain up-to-date protection against newly emerging malware and viruses.\n- Minimize the window of vulnerability to new threats.\n- Reduce reliance on manual updates, which are prone to human error or neglect.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nMalware evolves rapidly. Outdated anti-malware solutions are ineffective against new threats, leaving organizations exposed. Automatic, frequent updates are a baseline defense and are especially critical for organizations with limited IT resources, as they reduce the need for manual intervention.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- All anti-malware solutions in use are configured to auto-update signature files or equivalent detection mechanisms.\n- Updates occur at least daily (every 24 hours) or more frequently, where possible.\n- The organization can demonstrate this configuration through settings, screenshots, or policy documentation.\n- If using non-signature-based solutions (e.g., machine learning), evidence shows regular updates to detection models or equivalent mechanisms.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Anti-malware solutions are not set to auto-update, or updates are performed manually.\n- Updates occur less frequently than daily (e.g., weekly, ad hoc).\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence contradicts the self-assessment response.\n- The organization is unaware of the update frequency or cannot demonstrate the configuration.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some, but not all, devices or systems have auto-updates enabled.\n- Updates are set to occur, but frequency is unclear or less than daily.\n- The organization claims technical limitations but does not provide reasonable justification or compensating controls.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of systems.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of anti-malware settings showing auto-update enabled and update frequency.\n- Policy documents or IT procedures specifying update configuration.\n- Logs or reports from anti-malware solutions showing recent automatic updates.\n- Inventory list mapping anti-malware solutions to devices, with update settings.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 1-2 months).\n- Screenshots should clearly show device name, date/time, and relevant settings.\n- Policies/procedures must be in active use, not just templates.\n- Evidence should cover all relevant devices/endpoints.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Screenshots or documents are outdated or generic (e.g., vendor marketing material).\n- Evidence only covers a subset of devices, with no explanation for gaps.\n- Manual update logs presented as evidence of compliance.\n- Inconsistent or conflicting information between evidence and self-assessment answers.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Confirmation that all anti-malware solutions are set to auto-update at least daily.\n- Clear description of how updates are managed (centrally or per device).\n- Evidence that matches the stated process and covers all relevant systems.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"All company computers use [Vendor] Antivirus, which is set to auto-update signatures every 4 hours. See attached screenshots from three representative devices.\"\n- \"Our endpoint protection platform updates detection models automatically every 12 hours. Attached is a policy document and a screenshot from the admin console.\"\n- \"We use Windows Defender, which is configured via Group Policy to update signatures daily. See attached Group Policy screenshot and update logs.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We update antivirus when we remember.\"\n- \"Our IT person checks for updates weekly.\"\n- \"We believe updates are automatic, but we have no evidence.\"\n- \"Some computers update automatically, but we are unsure about the rest.\"\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide evidence for all device types in use (e.g., desktops, laptops, servers)?\n- How do you ensure new devices are configured for auto-updates?\n- If using non-signature-based solutions, how are detection mechanisms updated?\n- Are there any exceptions (e.g., offline devices)? How are these managed?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), spot-checking a sample of devices may be sufficient if supported by a clear policy.\n- For micro-businesses, a simple written procedure and a few screenshots may suffice.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept reasonable, practical evidence (e.g., screenshots, simple checklists) rather than enterprise-level reporting.\n- Manual update processes are not acceptable unless justified by technical constraints and accompanied by compensating controls.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For organizations with devices that cannot connect to the internet (e.g., in manufacturing), require a documented process for manual updates and risk mitigation.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming default settings are sufficient without verification.\n- Only updating some devices, not all.\n- Relying on outdated or unsupported anti-malware solutions.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots missing device identifiers or timestamps.\n- Policies not reflecting actual practice.\n- Evidence only for a subset of systems.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating \"auto-update enabled\" without proof.\n- Providing vendor brochures instead of actual configuration evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence that all anti-malware solutions are set to auto-update at least daily?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the evidence recent, device-specific, and covers all relevant systems?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on scope/gaps).\n\n3. **Are there any exceptions or gaps?**\n   - **No:** PASS.\n   - **Yes:** Assess if exceptions are justified and managed; otherwise, Partial Compliance or FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional information.\n- If technical limitations are cited, escalate to senior auditor for risk assessment.\n- If organization cannot provide evidence after follow-up, FAIL.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same evidence and frequency standards across all organizations.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- For similar organizations, ensure similar types and quality of evidence are accepted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and comprehensive evidence that all anti-malware solutions are set to auto-update at least daily. Responses lacking evidence, relying on manual updates, or covering only part of the environment should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the requirement for daily (or more frequent) automatic updates. Escalate unclear cases and ensure consistent application of these criteria.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that their anti-malware (antivirus) solution is configured to automatically scan files whenever they are accessed. This includes files and attachments that are:\n- Downloaded from the Internet (via web browsers or email)\n- Received from external sources (e.g., USB drives, external hard disks)\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent malware infections by detecting threats at the point of file access, before execution or further distribution.\n- Reduce the risk of malware spreading via common vectors (email, web downloads, removable media).\n\n**Why This Is Important:**  \nAutomatic, real-time scanning is a fundamental defense against malware. It ensures that threats are detected and blocked before they can cause harm, especially in organizations with limited cybersecurity expertise.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has an anti-malware solution installed on all relevant endpoints (workstations, laptops, servers).\n- The anti-malware solution is configured to automatically scan files upon access (real-time/on-access scanning is enabled).\n- The configuration covers files from all major sources: web downloads, email attachments, and external/removable media (e.g., USB drives).\n- Evidence provided (e.g., screenshots, configuration reports) clearly shows real-time/on-access scanning is enabled.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No anti-malware solution is in place, or it is not installed on all relevant devices.\n- Real-time/on-access scanning is disabled or not configured.\n- The solution only performs manual or scheduled scans, not automatic scans upon file access.\n- Evidence is missing, insufficient, or contradicts the self-assessment response.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Real-time scanning is enabled on some, but not all, devices.\n- Only certain file sources (e.g., web downloads) are covered, but not others (e.g., USB drives).\n- The organization claims compliance but cannot provide adequate supporting evidence.\n- The anti-malware solution is outdated or unsupported.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of anti-malware settings showing real-time/on-access scanning enabled.\n- Configuration reports or policy documents from the anti-malware solution.\n- Device inventory showing anti-malware deployment status.\n- (Optional) Screenshots or logs showing detection of test files from different sources (web, email, USB).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).\n- Screenshots must clearly show the device name, anti-malware product, and relevant settings.\n- Reports must be unaltered and directly from the anti-malware solution.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Generic statements without evidence (“We have antivirus installed”).\n- Outdated screenshots or reports.\n- Evidence from only one device when multiple are in use.\n- Evidence that does not clearly show real-time/on-access scanning.\n- Evidence from unsupported or consumer-grade solutions in a business context.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Confirmation that real-time/on-access scanning is enabled.\n- Coverage of all relevant endpoints and file sources.\n- Evidence that matches the organization’s IT environment.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Our anti-malware solution (e.g., Windows Defender, Sophos, McAfee) is installed on all computers. Real-time scanning is enabled, as shown in the attached screenshots from several devices. The settings show that files from web downloads, email, and USB drives are automatically scanned upon access.”\n- Screenshots showing “Real-time protection: ON” or similar wording.\n- Configuration reports listing “on-access scanning: enabled.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We run antivirus scans every week” (scheduled/manual only).\n- “We have antivirus installed” (no mention of real-time/on-access scanning).\n- No evidence provided, or evidence does not show relevant settings.\n- Evidence only from a single device when the organization has multiple endpoints.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide evidence from additional devices or platforms (if applicable)?\n- How do you ensure that real-time scanning remains enabled (e.g., policy, periodic checks)?\n- Are all types of files and sources (web, email, USB) covered by the scanning configuration?\n- What is your process for updating or replacing anti-malware solutions?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), evidence from all devices may be requested.\n- For larger organizations, a representative sample (e.g., 10-20%) may suffice if device types are consistent.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or built-in anti-malware solutions (e.g., Windows Defender) are acceptable if properly configured.\n- Complex enterprise solutions are not required, but basic real-time protection must be in place.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with high USB usage (e.g., manufacturing, logistics) should pay particular attention to external device scanning.\n- Sectors handling sensitive data may require stricter evidence of coverage.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Real-time scanning enabled only on some devices.\n- USB/external device scanning not enabled.\n- Staff can disable real-time scanning without oversight.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is outdated or from test environments.\n- Screenshots do not show relevant settings.\n- Reports are incomplete or redacted.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that mention “antivirus is installed” but do not address real-time/on-access scanning.\n- Evidence from personal devices instead of business endpoints.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is anti-malware installed on all relevant devices?**\n   - No → FAIL\n   - Yes → Continue\n\n2. **Is real-time/on-access scanning enabled and configured to scan files from web, email, and USB?**\n   - No → FAIL\n   - Yes → Continue\n\n3. **Is sufficient, recent, and credible evidence provided?**\n   - No → FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)\n   - Yes → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims technical limitations, verify if reasonable alternatives are in place.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same evidence and configuration standards across all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that real-time/on-access scanning is enabled on all relevant devices, covering files from all major sources. Responses must be supported by credible documentation or screenshots. Resource-appropriate solutions are acceptable, but the core requirement—automatic scanning upon file access—must be met for a PASS.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**\n- For all in-scope devices and environments (mobile devices, IoT devices, cloud platforms, web browsers, and email clients), the organization must implement appropriate anti-malware protections:\n  - **Mobile Devices:** Must have anti-malware solutions installed and running.\n  - **IoT Devices:** Must have anti-malware integrated, where feasible (e.g., CCTV, smart TVs, printers, digital locks).\n  - **Cloud Environments:** Must have anti-malware deployed on the cloud platform.\n  - **Web Browsers/Email Clients:** Must use only fully supported software with security controls, anti-phishing/spam filtering, unnecessary plugins/extensions disabled/removed, and web filtering deployed where feasible.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Prevent, detect, and mitigate malware infections across all relevant platforms.\n- Reduce risk of phishing, spam, and malicious web content.\n- Ensure only secure, supported software is used for critical business functions.\n\n**Context/Importance:**\n- Malware is a leading cause of breaches, especially via email, web browsing, and vulnerable devices.\n- Baseline anti-malware controls are essential to protect organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Mobile Devices:** All in-scope mobile devices have anti-malware installed, running, and regularly updated.\n- **IoT Devices:** Anti-malware is integrated where technically feasible, or compensating controls are documented for devices where anti-malware cannot be installed.\n- **Cloud:** Anti-malware is deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., endpoint protection for virtual machines, cloud-native security tools).\n- **Web/Email:** Only supported browsers/email clients are used; anti-phishing and spam filtering are enabled; unnecessary plugins/extensions are removed; web filtering is in place or justified if not feasible.\n- **Controls are documented and evidence is provided for each relevant environment.**\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No anti-malware present on in-scope devices/environments.\n- Use of unsupported browsers/email clients without security controls.\n- No anti-phishing/spam filtering or web filtering, with no justification.\n- Lack of evidence or vague, unsubstantiated claims.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some, but not all, in-scope devices/environments are protected.\n- Anti-malware is present but not running or not updated.\n- Web filtering or anti-phishing is only partially implemented.\n- Organization provides a plan for remediation but has not yet implemented controls.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots or reports showing anti-malware installed and running on mobile devices.\n- Device inventory lists with anti-malware status.\n- Screenshots/configurations of IoT devices showing anti-malware or compensating controls.\n- Cloud platform security dashboards or settings showing anti-malware deployment.\n- Lists of approved browsers/email clients; screenshots of security settings.\n- Evidence of anti-phishing/spam filtering and web filtering (e.g., admin console screenshots, policy documents).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).\n- Evidence must clearly show device names, software versions, and status.\n- Documentation must match the organization’s stated scope and inventory.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Generic statements without supporting evidence.\n- Outdated screenshots or reports.\n- Evidence that does not match the described environment (e.g., showing anti-malware on one device only).\n- Evidence of unsupported or end-of-life software in use.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### **Question: Are website-whitelisting controls implemented (employees can only visit whitelisted sites)?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Description of web filtering or whitelisting technology in use.\n- Evidence of web filtering policy or configuration.\n- Explanation if whitelisting is not feasible, with alternative controls described.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “We use [web filtering solution] to restrict access to approved websites. See attached screenshot of policy settings.”\n- “All employees access the internet via a secure gateway with whitelisting enabled. See evidence.”\n- “Web filtering is not feasible due to [business reason], but we have implemented DNS filtering and anti-phishing controls as compensating measures.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We trust employees to avoid bad sites.”\n- “No controls in place, but we plan to implement soon.”\n- “We use Chrome/Edge but have not configured any web filtering.”\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- Which web filtering or whitelisting solution is used? Is it centrally managed?\n- How often are the whitelists/filters reviewed and updated?\n- Are there exceptions, and how are they managed?\n- If not implemented, what compensating controls are in place?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), simple solutions (e.g., built-in browser controls, basic endpoint security suites) may be acceptable if they provide equivalent protection.\n- Manual processes may be acceptable if documented and consistently applied.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means using built-in security features or affordable third-party solutions.\n- If a control is not feasible (e.g., IoT device cannot support anti-malware), compensating controls (e.g., network segmentation, monitoring) must be documented.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, retail) may have unique IoT devices; feasibility of anti-malware must be considered.\n- Cloud environments may differ (IaaS vs SaaS); ensure controls are appropriate for the service model.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking mobile or IoT devices in scope.\n- Assuming built-in browser/email security is sufficient without configuration.\n- Not disabling unnecessary browser/email plugins.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence only for a subset of devices.\n- Screenshots without context (e.g., no device name, date).\n- Policies not reflecting actual practice.\n\n### False Positives\n- Claiming “all devices protected” but only showing evidence for one.\n- Relying solely on default settings without verification.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are all in-scope devices/environments identified?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Is anti-malware (or compensating control) implemented and evidenced for each?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Are web/email controls (supported software, anti-phishing, web filtering) implemented and evidenced?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n4. **Is evidence current, complete, and credible?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n5. **If all above are YES → PASS**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional information.\n- If compensating controls are claimed, escalate to senior auditor for review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and implementation across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nUse these criteria to systematically assess whether the organization’s self-assessment and evidence demonstrate adequate, practical, and proportionate implementation of anti-malware and web/email security controls across all relevant platforms. Ensure that controls are not only claimed but are evidenced, current, and appropriate for the organization’s size and context.",

Firewall rules should restrict and filter network traffic, blocking unauthorized or malicious connections.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access to internal systems and data.\n- Block malicious or suspicious network traffic.\n- Limit exposure to external threats by controlling inbound and outbound connections.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nFirewalls are a foundational security control, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity expertise. They provide a first line of defense against common cyberattacks by filtering traffic and blocking known threats, reducing the risk of compromise from external sources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Firewalls are deployed and enabled on all relevant endpoints (laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines).\n- Where an organizational network exists, a perimeter firewall is present and actively configured.\n- Firewall rules are in place to restrict unauthorized inbound and outbound traffic.\n- The organization can describe or show how firewall rules are set to block malicious IPs or filter suspicious traffic.\n- Evidence demonstrates that only authorized network traffic is allowed into the organization’s network.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No firewalls are deployed or enabled on endpoints or network perimeter.\n- Firewall is present but not configured (default/allow-all settings).\n- No evidence of firewall rules restricting or filtering traffic.\n- Organization cannot describe or provide evidence of how firewalls are used to block malicious traffic.\n- Firewall is disabled or not maintained.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Firewalls are present but only partially configured (e.g., enabled on some but not all endpoints).\n- Firewall rules exist but are overly permissive or not regularly reviewed.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of firewall settings on endpoints and/or network devices.\n- Exported firewall rule lists or configuration summaries.\n- Network diagrams showing firewall placement.\n- Policy documents or SOPs referencing firewall management.\n- Device inventory showing firewall-enabled devices.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 6 months).\n- Screenshots/configurations must clearly show firewall status and rule sets.\n- Documentation should match the organization’s described network setup.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not organization-specific.\n- Screenshots show default/allow-all rules.\n- No evidence of firewall rules or only references to “having a firewall” without detail.\n- Evidence is inconsistent with the organization’s size or IT environment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: Is there a firewall? Are rules in place to filter malicious traffic and block malicious IPs?\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Confirmation that firewalls are enabled on all relevant devices.\n- Description or evidence of rules that block or filter malicious traffic/IPs.\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- “Yes, all company laptops and desktops have Windows Defender Firewall enabled with default-deny inbound rules.”\n- “Our office router has a firewall enabled with rules to block known malicious IPs and restrict inbound traffic to VPN only.”\n- Screenshot of firewall rule list showing blocked ports/IPs.\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- “We have a router from our ISP, but we don’t know if the firewall is on.”\n- “We rely on antivirus only.”\n- No mention of rules or filtering.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- Can you provide a screenshot or export of your firewall rules?\n- How do you update or review your firewall rules?\n- Are all endpoints protected, including remote workers?\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Is there firewall configured to accept only authorised network traffic into the organisation network?\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Evidence of a perimeter firewall (if applicable) with rules restricting inbound traffic.\n- Description of what “authorized” traffic means for the organization.\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- “Our perimeter firewall only allows inbound VPN connections; all other inbound traffic is blocked.”\n- “We have a DNS firewall that blocks access to known malicious domains.”\n- Screenshot of firewall configuration showing restricted inbound rules.\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- “We allow all inbound traffic.”\n- “We don’t know what traffic is allowed.”\n- No evidence of configuration.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- What types of inbound connections are permitted, and why?\n- How do you ensure only authorized traffic is allowed?\n- Who manages and reviews firewall configurations?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For micro/small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), built-in OS firewalls (Windows/Mac) and ISP-provided router firewalls are acceptable if properly configured.\n- For larger organizations or those with a dedicated office network, a perimeter firewall is expected.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Expect simple, practical implementations (e.g., default-deny inbound, basic rule sets).\n- Do not require enterprise-grade firewall appliances unless justified by organization size/complexity.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter firewall configurations.\n- Remote-only organizations may rely on endpoint firewalls rather than a network perimeter device.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Firewalls enabled but with default/allow-all rules.\n- Only some devices protected.\n- No regular review or update of firewall rules.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots not showing relevant settings.\n- Evidence from personal/home devices instead of organizational assets.\n- Outdated or missing documentation.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating “firewall is enabled” without evidence of rule configuration.\n- Confusing antivirus with firewall functionality.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is a firewall present and enabled on all relevant devices?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Are firewall rules configured to restrict unauthorized/malicious traffic?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Is there evidence (screenshots, configs, policies) supporting the above?**\n   - If NO or insufficient → FAIL or Partial (request more info)\n4. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**\n   - If NO → FAIL or Partial (request more info)\n5. **If all YES → PASS**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If organization claims unique circumstances (e.g., all cloud-based, no internal network), escalate for review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria for similar organization types and sizes.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, current evidence that firewalls are enabled and configured to restrict unauthorized/malicious traffic on all relevant devices and networks. Responses must go beyond simply stating “firewall is enabled” and should demonstrate practical implementation appropriate to the organization’s size and resources. Incomplete, outdated, or generic responses should be followed up or marked as FAIL. Consistency and proportionality are key—ensure requirements are scaled to the organization’s context while maintaining baseline security standards.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nAll endpoints (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, servers) that connect to the Internet and/or cloud-based applications must have a software (host-based) firewall configured and switched on, wherever this feature is available. This typically means enabling the built-in firewall in operating systems (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall, macOS Firewall) or using a firewall feature in endpoint security/anti-malware solutions.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized inbound and outbound network connections on endpoints.\n- Reduce the risk of malware spreading or attackers gaining access to endpoints.\n- Provide a baseline layer of defense, especially for devices outside the organization’s physical perimeter.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nHost-based firewalls are a critical last line of defense, especially for remote or mobile endpoints. They are easy to enable and require minimal ongoing management, making them a practical and effective control for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization confirms that a software firewall is configured and switched on for **all** endpoints where available.\n- The response covers all relevant device types (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).\n- There is evidence (e.g., screenshots, policy documents, configuration reports) showing firewalls are enabled.\n- If any endpoints do not support a software firewall, a reasonable explanation is provided (e.g., legacy devices, IoT devices), and these are documented as exceptions.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The organization cannot confirm that firewalls are enabled on all endpoints.\n- The response is vague, incomplete, or only covers some endpoints.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly outdated or irrelevant.\n- The organization relies solely on a network firewall and does not address host-based firewalls.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Firewalls are enabled on most, but not all, endpoints, with some gaps or unclear exceptions.\n- The organization is in the process of enabling firewalls but has not completed the rollout.\n- Evidence is provided for some, but not all, device types.\n- Further clarification or additional evidence is needed to determine compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of firewall settings from representative endpoints (e.g., Windows Security Center, macOS Security & Privacy).\n- Device management reports showing firewall status across the fleet.\n- Written IT policy or procedure stating that firewalls must be enabled.\n- Inventory or list of endpoints with firewall status indicated.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).\n- Screenshots should clearly show the firewall is enabled and, if possible, the device name or user.\n- Reports should cover all relevant device types and indicate coverage (e.g., “100% of Windows laptops have firewall enabled”).\n- Policies should be dated and reflect current practice.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, not organization-specific, or appears copied from the Internet.\n- Screenshots are old, cropped, or do not show relevant details.\n- No evidence for certain device types (e.g., only Windows, but organization also uses Macs).\n- Policy exists, but no proof of actual implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Explicit confirmation that software firewalls are enabled on all endpoints.\n- Mention of all operating systems in use.\n- Evidence that matches the organization’s device inventory.\n- Any exceptions are clearly listed and justified.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “All company laptops and desktops (Windows and Mac) have the built-in firewall enabled. See attached screenshots from both OS types and a device management report showing compliance.”\n- “Our IT policy requires firewalls to be enabled on all endpoints. Attached is a screenshot from our endpoint management tool showing 100% compliance.”\n- “We have 10 Windows PCs and 2 Macs; all have their respective firewalls enabled. See attached screenshots.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We have a firewall on our network, so we don’t need to enable software firewalls.”\n- “We think most computers have it enabled, but we haven’t checked.”\n- “No evidence provided.”\n- “Only Windows devices have firewalls enabled; Macs are not mentioned.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide evidence for all device types in use?”\n- “How do you ensure new devices have the firewall enabled?”\n- “Are there any exceptions? If so, please explain and document them.”\n- “When was the last time you verified firewall status across all endpoints?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 endpoints), manual checks and screenshots are acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect some form of centralized reporting or inventory.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Built-in OS firewalls are sufficient; no need for advanced or paid solutions.\n- Manual processes are acceptable if documented and consistently applied.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some specialized devices (e.g., POS terminals, medical devices) may not support host-based firewalls; these should be documented as exceptions with justification.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming a network firewall is sufficient and ignoring host-based firewalls.\n- Overlooking non-Windows devices (e.g., Macs, Linux).\n- Not checking or documenting the status on all endpoints.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated screenshots or reports.\n- Policies that are not enforced in practice.\n- Evidence that does not match the organization’s device inventory.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy exists, but no proof of implementation.\n- Evidence from only a subset of devices.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there explicit confirmation that software firewalls are enabled on all endpoints?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Continue\n\n2. **Is there recent, organization-specific evidence for all device types?**\n   - **No** → Partial/FAIL (request more evidence)\n   - **Yes** → Continue\n\n3. **Are any exceptions documented and justified?**\n   - **No** → FAIL (unless all endpoints are covered)\n   - **Yes** → Continue\n\n4. **Does the evidence match the organization’s inventory and policy?**\n   - **No** → Partial/FAIL\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims technical limitations, verify the legitimacy and reasonableness of the exception.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and coverage across all organizations of similar size and device mix.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or exception cases.\n\n---\n\n**Use this framework to ensure a thorough, fair, and consistent evaluation of compliance with the software firewall requirement under Cyber Essentials Provision A.4.4g.**",

Provision Overview\n\n**Provision Requirement:**  \nAs good practice, firewall configurations and rules should ideally be reviewed and verified annually to protect the organisation’s Internet-facing assets where applicable.\n\n**Practical Explanation:**  \nOrganizations must review and verify the configuration and rules of their firewalls at least once every 12 months. This review should cover all Internet-facing firewalls (e.g., those protecting servers, cloud services, or office networks exposed to the Internet). The review aims to ensure that only necessary ports/services are open, rules are up-to-date, and no unauthorized changes have occurred.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Reduce exposure to external threats by ensuring only required services are accessible.\n- Detect and remediate misconfigurations or outdated rules that could be exploited.\n- Maintain an up-to-date understanding of the organization’s network perimeter.\n\n**Importance:**  \nFirewalls are a primary defense against external attacks. Regular reviews help prevent attackers from exploiting forgotten or misconfigured rules, which is a common cause of breaches.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization states that firewall rules/configurations are reviewed at least annually (every 12 months or more frequently).\n- The review includes all Internet-facing firewalls.\n- There is evidence of the review process (e.g., logs, checklists, meeting notes, or change records).\n- The review is documented and shows that findings are acted upon if issues are found.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No review of firewall rules/configurations is conducted, or reviews are ad hoc/irregular (less than once per year).\n- The organization cannot specify when the last review occurred.\n- Only partial coverage (e.g., only some firewalls reviewed, or only after incidents).\n- No evidence or documentation of reviews.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization reviews firewalls less frequently than annually (e.g., every 18 months).\n- The review is informal or undocumented.\n- Only some Internet-facing firewalls are included.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Review logs or records (e.g., checklist, signed-off document, ticketing system entry).\n- Change management records showing firewall rule reviews.\n- Meeting notes or emails referencing firewall rule review.\n- Screenshots of review schedules or completed reviews.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be dated and clearly reference the firewall(s) in question.\n- Should show that a review took place within the last 12 months.\n- Should indicate what was reviewed and any actions taken.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated, generic, or not specific to firewall reviews.\n- Evidence is older than 12 months.\n- Evidence is fabricated (e.g., templates with no real data, or backdated documents).\n- No mention of Internet-facing assets.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear statement of review frequency (e.g., “annually,” “every 6 months”).\n- Description of what is reviewed (all Internet-facing firewalls).\n- Evidence of the last review (date, scope, findings).\n- Indication that reviews are scheduled or part of a process.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Firewall rules are reviewed annually. The last review was in March 2024, covering all Internet-facing firewalls. See attached checklist and meeting notes.”\n- “We have a process to review firewall rules every 12 months. Attached is the change log from our last review in January 2024.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We review firewall rules when needed.”\n- “No formal review process, but we check when there are issues.”\n- “Not sure when the last review was.”\n- “We don’t have any firewalls.” (If the organization has Internet-facing assets, this is a red flag.)\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide documentation or records of your last firewall rule review?”\n- “Which firewalls are included in your review process?”\n- “How do you ensure all Internet-facing assets are covered?”\n- “What actions do you take if issues are found during the review?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple checklist or email record of the review is acceptable.\n- If using managed services, confirmation from the provider that reviews are performed annually is sufficient.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- The process does not need to be complex; a basic documented review is adequate.\n- Automated firewall management tools or third-party reviews are acceptable if documented.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements, but Cyber Essentials only requires annual review as a baseline.\n- Cloud-only organizations should review cloud firewall/security group rules.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Reviews are performed but not documented.\n- Only internal (non-Internet-facing) firewalls are reviewed.\n- Reviews are forgotten or performed less than annually.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is missing, outdated, or not specific to firewall reviews.\n- Reliance on verbal confirmation without written records.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating a review occurs without any supporting evidence.\n- Confusing firewall rule changes with a comprehensive review.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented process or evidence showing firewall rules are reviewed at least annually?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Does the review cover all Internet-facing firewalls?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on scope).\n\n3. **Is the evidence dated within the last 12 months and specific to firewall reviews?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims not to have Internet-facing assets, verify this claim.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for size and complexity as outlined above.\n- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate (with evidence) that all Internet-facing firewall rules are reviewed at least annually, and that this review is documented. Accept simple, proportionate evidence for small organizations, but do not accept undocumented or ad hoc processes. Escalate unclear or suspicious cases for further review.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must demonstrate that, where the certification scope includes mobile and/or IoT devices, firewalls are installed and enabled on employees’ mobile devices and configured/enabled on IoT devices wherever possible. This is a **recommended** (not strictly mandatory) control, but organizations are expected to show reasonable effort to implement it, or provide a justified explanation if not feasible.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Reduce the risk of malware and unauthorized access on mobile and IoT devices.\n- Prevent lateral movement of threats within the organization’s network.\n- Establish a baseline of device-level protection, especially for devices that may operate outside the organization’s perimeter.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nMobile and IoT devices are common entry points for cyber threats due to their mobility, diversity, and often limited built-in security. Enabling firewalls helps block malicious traffic and unauthorized connections, providing an essential layer of defense for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization clearly identifies whether mobile and/or IoT devices are in scope.\n- For **mobile devices**:  \n  - Firewalls are installed and enabled on all employee mobile devices, **or**  \n  - If not, a reasonable explanation is provided (e.g., technical limitations, OS restrictions, or managed via MDM with equivalent protections).\n- For **IoT devices**:  \n  - Firewalls are configured and enabled where technically possible, **or**  \n  - If not possible, a reasonable explanation is provided (e.g., device does not support firewall, alternative network segmentation is in place).\n- The organization demonstrates awareness of the recommendation and has taken reasonable steps to comply or mitigate.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No mention of firewalls on mobile or IoT devices, despite such devices being in scope.\n- Blanket statements such as “not applicable” without justification.\n- No evidence of consideration or action regarding firewalls.\n- Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., “all devices are protected” with no details).\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- Firewalls are enabled on some, but not all, devices, with partial justification.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing firewalls, with a clear plan and timeline.\n- The explanation for not enabling firewalls is vague or incomplete.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Device configuration screenshots showing firewall status (enabled/disabled).\n- Mobile Device Management (MDM) policy documentation or screenshots.\n- Network diagrams or inventory lists indicating IoT device firewall status.\n- Written explanations for exceptions (e.g., device limitations, alternative controls).\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 6–12 months).\n- Screenshots must clearly show device type, firewall status, and date/time if possible.\n- Policy documents should be specific to mobile/IoT devices and reference firewall controls.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Generic policy statements with no device-specific evidence.\n- Outdated screenshots or documents.\n- Evidence that does not match the devices in scope.\n- Copy-pasted or template responses with no organization-specific details.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Confirmation that mobile and/or IoT devices are in scope.\n- Clear statement on whether firewalls are installed/enabled on these devices.\n- If not enabled, a specific and reasonable explanation.\n- Supporting evidence as described above.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “All company-issued mobile phones have firewalls enabled via MDM. See attached screenshots from our MDM dashboard.”\n- “Our IoT cameras do not support onboard firewalls, but they are isolated on a separate VLAN with firewall rules at the network level. See attached network diagram.”\n- “We use iOS devices, which have built-in firewall features managed via Apple Business Manager. See attached policy.”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “Not applicable” with no further explanation.\n- “We assume all devices are protected.”\n- “We don’t have firewalls on IoT devices” with no justification or alternative controls.\n- Evidence that is generic, outdated, or unrelated to the devices in question.\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- Can you provide screenshots or documentation showing firewall status on a sample of devices?\n- If firewalls are not enabled, what alternative protections are in place?\n- How do you ensure new devices are configured with firewalls upon deployment?\n- Are there any devices for which enabling a firewall is not possible? Please specify.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a sample of device screenshots or a simple written policy may suffice.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized MDM or inventory documentation.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- If technical limitations prevent firewall installation, a reasonable explanation and evidence of alternative controls (e.g., network segmentation) is acceptable.\n- “Reasonable effort” means at least considering the recommendation and documenting the decision process.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Some industries (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing) may use IoT devices with limited security features; alternative compensating controls should be described.\n- For organizations with BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), clarify how firewall controls are enforced or recommended.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Failing to consider IoT devices as part of the scope.\n- Assuming built-in OS protections are sufficient without verification.\n- Not documenting exceptions or alternative controls.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Lack of device-specific evidence.\n- Outdated or irrelevant screenshots.\n- Policies that do not mention mobile or IoT devices.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Statements of compliance without supporting evidence.\n- Over-reliance on “default” device settings without confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Are mobile and/or IoT devices in scope?**\n   - If no, mark as PASS (not applicable).\n   - If yes, proceed.\n2. **Are firewalls installed/enabled on these devices?**\n   - If yes, and evidence is provided, PASS.\n   - If no, is there a reasonable, documented explanation and/or alternative controls?  \n     - If yes, PASS.\n     - If no, FAIL.\n3. **Is the evidence sufficient, recent, and device-specific?**\n   - If yes, PASS.\n   - If no, FAIL or request clarification.\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If the explanation for non-implementation is unclear or seems unreasonable, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent, escalate for further review.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and justification across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or exception cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, device-specific evidence that firewalls are enabled on mobile and IoT devices where possible, or a reasonable explanation and alternative controls where not possible. Responses must be supported by recent, credible evidence and tailored to the organization’s actual device landscape.

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**Provision Requirement:**  \nThe organisation shall ensure that its employees install/access only authorised software/attachments within the organisation from official or trusted sources.\n\n**Practical Explanation:**  \nThis provision requires organizations to implement controls that prevent employees from installing or accessing unauthorized software or attachments, and to ensure that any software or documents accessed are from official or trusted sources (e.g., vendor websites, official app stores, or pre-approved internal repositories).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent introduction of malware or viruses via unauthorized or untrusted software/attachments.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches, ransomware, or system compromise.\n- Maintain a controlled and secure IT environment.\n\n**Importance:**  \nUncontrolled installation or access to software and attachments is a leading cause of malware infections and security incidents, especially in organizations with limited IT oversight. This provision is a foundational defense against common cyber threats.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization has clear, communicated policies or controls restricting software/attachment installation/access to authorized sources only.\n- There are technical or procedural measures in place (e.g., user permissions, application whitelisting, restricted admin rights, email filtering, or documented approval processes).\n- Employees are aware of these restrictions and know how to request new software or report suspicious attachments.\n- Evidence supports that these measures are implemented and enforced.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No controls or policies exist to restrict software/attachment installation or access.\n- Employees can freely install or access any software/attachments without oversight.\n- No evidence of enforcement or communication of such restrictions.\n- Reliance solely on “trusting employees” without supporting controls.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- Some controls exist but are inconsistently applied (e.g., only on some devices or for some users).\n- Policies exist but are not communicated or enforced.\n- Technical controls are present but easily bypassed or not monitored.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the organization.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Written policies or guidelines on software/attachment installation/access.\n- Screenshots or system settings showing restricted installation rights or application whitelisting.\n- Email filtering or attachment scanning configurations.\n- Training materials or communications to staff about these restrictions.\n- Logs or records of software approval requests or incidents of blocked installations.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Policies/guidelines should be accessible and relevant to the organization’s environment.\n- Technical evidence should clearly show restrictions in place (e.g., standard user accounts, blocked installation prompts).\n- Training or communication evidence should demonstrate staff awareness.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Outdated or generic policies not tailored to the organization.\n- Evidence only from a single device or user, not representative of the organization.\n- Screenshots or documents with missing or redacted key information.\n- No evidence of staff awareness or enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **Question:**  \n**IT: What measures are in place to ensure that employees can only install / access authorised software / documents?**\n\n#### **What to Look For**\n- Description of both policy and technical/procedural controls.\n- Mention of restricted user permissions, application whitelisting, or approval processes.\n- Reference to email filtering or attachment scanning.\n- Evidence that these measures are communicated and enforced.\n\n#### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “Employees have standard user accounts and cannot install software without IT approval. All software installations require a request to IT, who install only from official sources. Email attachments are scanned for malware, and staff are trained not to open suspicious files.”\n- “We use application whitelisting to allow only approved software. Staff receive regular reminders about not installing unauthorized software or opening unknown attachments.”\n- Supporting evidence: screenshots of user permissions, policy documents, training records, or email filtering settings.\n\n#### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “We trust our employees to only install safe software.”\n- “There is no restriction, but we tell staff to be careful.”\n- “Anyone can install software if they want.”\n- No supporting evidence or only verbal assurances.\n\n#### **Follow-up Questions**\n- How are employees prevented from installing unauthorized software in practice?\n- How are new software requests handled and approved?\n- How are staff informed about these restrictions?\n- Can you provide examples of how unauthorized installation attempts are detected or blocked?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), written policies may be brief, but technical controls (e.g., standard user accounts) should still be in place.\n- In micro-businesses, a simple documented process (e.g., “only the owner can install software”) may suffice if enforced.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Expect practical, low-cost controls (e.g., using built-in OS permissions, free email filtering).\n- Do not require enterprise-level solutions, but basic controls must be present.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Sectors handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter controls.\n- For organizations with field staff or BYOD, look for mobile device management or clear guidance on personal device use.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Policies exist but are not enforced or communicated.\n- Technical controls only on some devices.\n- Over-reliance on user awareness without supporting controls.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Policies are outdated or not organization-specific.\n- Evidence is anecdotal or lacks proof of implementation.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Responses that describe intentions (“we plan to restrict installations”) but lack current implementation.\n- Screenshots or documents that do not match the described environment.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Are there documented or technical controls restricting installation/access to authorized software/attachments?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n2. **Are these controls enforced and communicated to staff?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance (if some evidence exists)\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n3. **Is there credible, current evidence supporting these claims?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers the organization, request additional evidence or clarification.\n- Escalate to senior auditor if organization claims “unique” circumstances or if evidence is contradictory.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size or sector.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, enforced measures—both policy and technical—that prevent unauthorized software/attachment installation or access, supported by credible evidence. Responses lacking controls, enforcement, or evidence should be marked as FAIL, with partial compliance noted for incomplete implementations. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but basic controls must always be present.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must ensure that all employees are aware of the need to use only trusted network connections (such as corporate Wi-Fi, VPN, or secure mobile hotspots) when accessing organizational data or business email. This includes understanding the risks of using untrusted or public networks and knowing the correct procedures for connecting securely.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access or interception of sensitive data via insecure networks.\n- Reduce the risk of malware infection or data leakage through compromised or public Wi-Fi.\n- Foster a security-aware culture among employees regarding safe network practices.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUntrusted networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi) are common attack vectors for cybercriminals to intercept data or inject malware. Ensuring employees are aware of and use only trusted connections is a fundamental, cost-effective defense for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization demonstrates that employees are **explicitly informed** about the requirement to use trusted network connections for business data/email access.\n- There is **evidence of awareness activities** (e.g., onboarding materials, policy documents, email reminders, or training sessions).\n- Employees can **identify examples** of trusted (e.g., VPN, corporate Wi-Fi) and untrusted (e.g., public Wi-Fi at cafes) networks.\n- The response covers **all relevant access scenarios** (office, remote, mobile).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence that employees are made aware of trusted network requirements.\n- Vague or generic statements (e.g., “Employees know to be careful online”) without specifics.\n- No mention of trusted/untrusted network types or examples.\n- No supporting documentation or evidence of awareness activities.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some awareness activities exist, but coverage is incomplete (e.g., only new hires, not all staff).\n- Evidence is outdated or not organization-wide.\n- Employees are aware in some contexts (e.g., office) but not others (e.g., remote work).\n- Requires follow-up to clarify scope or recency.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Employee communications (emails, memos) about network use.\n- Excerpts from onboarding or security awareness training materials.\n- Acceptable Use Policy or IT policy referencing network connection requirements.\n- Screenshots or records of training completion.\n- Survey results or attestations from staff.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last 12 months).\n- Should **explicitly mention** trusted network connections and provide examples.\n- Should demonstrate **organization-wide coverage** (not just IT staff).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated or several years old.\n- Only policy documents with no proof of employee communication or training.\n- Evidence refers only to “secure connections” without defining or exemplifying.\n- No evidence provided, or evidence is clearly generic or templated.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that employees are **informed/trained** about using trusted networks.\n- Specific mention of **VPN, corporate Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot** as trusted options.\n- Examples or definitions of **untrusted networks** (e.g., public Wi-Fi).\n- Evidence that **all employees** (not just IT) are covered.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “All staff receive annual security awareness training that includes a section on using only corporate Wi-Fi or VPN for accessing business email and data. See attached training slides and attendance records.”\n- “Our Acceptable Use Policy, distributed to all employees, states that only trusted networks (corporate Wi-Fi, VPN, or personal mobile hotspot) may be used for business access. See attached policy and distribution email.”\n- “Onboarding checklist includes a briefing on network security. See onboarding document and signed acknowledgment forms.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We tell staff to be careful online.”\n- “We have a policy, but it’s only for IT staff.”\n- “No formal communication, but employees know not to use public Wi-Fi.”\n- “No evidence provided.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “How are remote or mobile employees made aware of these requirements?”\n- “When was the last time this information was communicated to staff?”\n- “Can you provide a sample of the communication or training material?”\n- “How do you ensure new hires are informed?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal but **documented communication** (e.g., group email, team meeting notes) is acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized and repeatable processes.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Awareness can be achieved through simple, low-cost means (e.g., email reminders, short training videos).\n- No requirement for expensive training platforms or complex policy management.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with high remote work (e.g., consulting, sales) should show evidence relevant to mobile/remote scenarios.\n- Sectors with mostly on-premises work may have simpler requirements but must still address remote access if it occurs.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming verbal or informal communication is sufficient without documentation.\n- Only IT staff are informed, not all employees.\n- Outdated or one-off awareness activities.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Missing dates or recipient lists for communications.\n- Policies that mention “secure connections” but do not define or exemplify.\n\n### False Positives\n- Evidence of a general security policy without specific reference to network connection requirements.\n- Training materials that do not mention trusted/untrusted networks.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence that all employees are made aware of the need to use trusted network connections?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Does the evidence explicitly mention trusted network types (e.g., VPN, corporate Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot) and provide examples?**\n   - **No** → FAIL or Partial (if partially addressed)\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is the evidence recent and organization-wide?**\n   - **No** → Partial (request update or clarification)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers the requirement, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and organization-wide evidence that employees are made aware of the need to use trusted network connections for business data/email access, with specific examples and coverage of all relevant scenarios. Responses lacking documentation, specificity, or recency should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed.

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must ensure that all employees know they are required to promptly report any suspicious emails or attachments to the designated IT team or, if no IT team exists, to senior management. This awareness should be organization-wide, not limited to IT staff.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Early detection and containment of phishing, malware, and other email-borne threats.\n- Minimizing the risk of malware infection or data compromise by ensuring rapid escalation of suspicious activity.\n- Fostering a security-aware culture where employees act as the first line of defense.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nEmail is a primary vector for cyberattacks. Prompt reporting of suspicious emails enables organizations to respond quickly, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks and limiting potential damage. For resource-constrained organizations, employee vigilance is critical.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides clear evidence that employees are **aware** of the requirement to report suspicious emails/attachments **immediately** to IT or senior management.\n- There is a **defined reporting channel** (e.g., email address, phone number, escalation process).\n- Awareness is **demonstrated across all staff**, not just IT personnel.\n- Evidence (if provided) is **current** (within the last 12 months).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence or only vague statements about employee awareness.\n- Reporting requirement is not communicated to all staff.\n- No defined reporting channel or process.\n- Evidence is outdated, irrelevant, or missing.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some, but not all, employees are aware (e.g., only new hires or only IT staff).\n- Reporting process exists but is informal or inconsistently communicated.\n- Evidence suggests awareness but lacks clarity or completeness.\n- In such cases, request further evidence or clarification.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Training materials** (slides, handouts, emails) referencing suspicious email reporting.\n- **Employee communications** (memos, newsletters, intranet posts) outlining the reporting requirement.\n- **Policy documents** or staff handbooks mentioning the process.\n- **Screenshots** of reminders or instructions (e.g., posters, email banners).\n- **Sample incident reports** (with sensitive data redacted) showing actual reporting.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be **specific** to the reporting of suspicious emails/attachments.\n- Should cover **all staff** (not just IT or management).\n- Must be **recent** (within the last year).\n- Should clearly indicate **how** and **to whom** to report.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Generic security awareness materials with no mention of reporting.\n- Evidence only covers a subset of employees.\n- Outdated documents (older than 12 months).\n- No proof of communication or training.\n- Fabricated or template evidence with no organization-specific details.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Explicit mention in responses that **all employees** are informed about reporting suspicious emails/attachments.\n- Description of **how** employees are made aware (e.g., induction, annual training, regular reminders).\n- Details of the **reporting process** (who to contact, how to report).\n- Evidence that communication is **ongoing** (not a one-off).\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"All staff receive annual cybersecurity training that includes instructions to report suspicious emails to IT at it-support@company.com or, if unavailable, to the General Manager.\"\n- \"We have a policy in our employee handbook (see attached excerpt) requiring immediate reporting of suspicious emails to the IT lead.\"\n- \"Monthly email reminders are sent to all staff, and posters are displayed in the office (see attached photo).\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"Our IT team knows to report suspicious emails.\"\n- \"We tell new hires about phishing, but there is no formal process.\"\n- \"Employees can report if they want, but it's not required.\"\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- How is this requirement communicated to existing staff and new hires?\n- Can you provide a sample communication or training material?\n- How often is this information reinforced or refreshed?\n- Who is responsible for receiving and acting on these reports?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- **Very small organizations** (e.g., <10 staff): Accept informal but clear communication (e.g., group chat message, verbal briefing with written confirmation).\n- **Larger organizations**: Expect more formalized communication (e.g., documented policy, regular training).\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept low-cost or simple awareness methods (e.g., email, posters, short briefings) as long as they are effective and reach all staff.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with higher email risk (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more frequent reminders.\n- For organizations with no dedicated IT, reporting to senior management is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only IT staff are aware of the reporting requirement.\n- No evidence of communication to non-IT staff.\n- Reporting process is unclear or not documented.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is outdated or generic.\n- No proof that all staff are covered.\n- Missing or incomplete artifacts.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that mention general awareness but do not specify reporting requirements.\n- Evidence of security training with no reference to reporting suspicious emails.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence that all employees are aware of the need to report suspicious emails/attachments immediately?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Is there a defined reporting process/channel (to IT or senior management)?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is the evidence recent (within 12 months) and organization-specific?**\n   - **No** → FAIL or Partial (request update)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers staff, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes requirement or provides conflicting information.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Use provided examples to calibrate judgments across assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must show that all employees are aware of the need to report suspicious emails/attachments immediately, with a clear process and recent, credible evidence. Responses lacking specificity, coverage, or current evidence should FAIL or be flagged for further review. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the core requirement of organization-wide awareness and reporting.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must establish and maintain an up-to-date inventory of all user accounts that have access to their systems, data, and services. This includes accounts for workstations, servers, and, where applicable, personal devices used to access organizational resources. The inventory can be managed using simple tools such as spreadsheets or by exporting lists from directory services (e.g., Active Directory, Google Workspace).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure only authorized individuals have access to organizational resources.\n- Enable prompt identification and removal of unnecessary or risky accounts.\n- Reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to forgotten, orphaned, or unmanaged accounts.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nAccount management is a foundational control for preventing unauthorized access and limiting the impact of compromised credentials. For resource-constrained organizations, a simple, well-maintained account inventory is a practical and effective baseline measure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization maintains a current, documented inventory of all login accounts for workstations and servers.\n- The inventory includes all relevant accounts (e.g., staff, contractors, service accounts).\n- The inventory is updated regularly (at least quarterly or when staff changes occur).\n- If personal devices are used to access organizational networks, there is a list of these devices and associated users.\n- The process for updating and reviewing the account inventory is described and evidence is provided.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No account inventory exists, or the organization cannot produce one.\n- The inventory is clearly outdated (e.g., contains ex-employees, missing new hires).\n- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only covers some systems, omits personal devices used for access).\n- No process exists for maintaining or updating the inventory.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- An inventory exists but is missing some elements (e.g., only covers workstations, not servers or personal devices).\n- The inventory is not regularly updated, or the update process is unclear.\n- Evidence is insufficient to confirm the inventory is current or complete.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Account inventory list (spreadsheet, export from directory service, etc.).\n- Documentation or description of the process for updating and reviewing the inventory.\n- Screenshots or exports from account management tools (if used).\n- For personal devices: a list or register of devices and users.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be dated within the last 3–6 months.\n- The inventory should clearly identify accounts by user, system, and (if applicable) device.\n- The process documentation should be clear and actionable.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated or obviously outdated.\n- Inventory lists are incomplete or generic (e.g., only showing “admin” or “user”).\n- No evidence of regular review or update.\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., template lists with no real data).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: What is the current process for reporting a stolen or lost corporate device?\n- **What to Look For:** Description of a process that includes disabling or reviewing accounts associated with lost/stolen devices.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “When a device is reported lost, IT disables the user account and removes it from the inventory.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “We don’t have a process,” or “We just tell the manager.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:** “How do you ensure accounts linked to lost devices are removed or disabled?”\n\n### Q2: Is there a permanent office location?\n- **What to Look For:** Not directly related to account inventory, but may affect how devices and accounts are managed.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** Clear statement of office location or remote-only status.\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** Unclear or contradictory answers.\n- **Follow-up Questions:** “How does your office setup affect account management?”\n\n### Q3: Is there a list of login accounts for all workstations and servers?\n- **What to Look For:** Existence of a comprehensive, current list.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, we maintain a spreadsheet/export from Active Directory updated monthly. Here is a sample.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No,” “Not sure,” or “We rely on memory.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:** “Can you provide a recent copy of the account list?”\n\n### Q4: Does the organization maintain a list of personal devices used to access its networks?\n- **What to Look For:** A register of personal devices and associated users.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, we have a BYOD register updated quarterly.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No,” “We don’t track personal devices.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:** “How do you ensure only authorized personal devices are allowed?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or even a documented list is acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized inventories and processes.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual processes are acceptable if they are documented and consistently applied.\n- Automated tools are not required but may be used.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations in regulated sectors may have stricter requirements; however, Cyber Essentials baseline applies to all.\n- Remote or hybrid organizations must account for personal devices and remote access.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Inventory only covers some systems (e.g., desktops but not servers).\n- No tracking of personal devices used for work.\n- Inventory not updated after staff changes.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is outdated or missing.\n- Inventory is not clearly linked to actual users or devices.\n\n### False Positives\n- Organization claims to have an inventory but cannot produce it.\n- Inventory is a template, not a real, populated list.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a current, documented inventory of all login accounts for workstations and servers?**\n   - If YES, proceed.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the inventory complete and regularly updated?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n3. **Are personal devices tracked if they access organizational resources?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL or partial compliance (depending on context).\n\n4. **Is the process for maintaining the inventory described and evidenced?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, request further information.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate a current, complete, and regularly updated inventory of all accounts (and personal devices, if applicable), with a clear process for maintenance. Evidence must be credible and recent. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept the absence of any account management process.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4b  \n**Secure/Protect: Access Control – Account Inventory List Completeness**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must maintain an up-to-date account inventory list that includes all user, administrator, third-party, and service accounts. For each account, the inventory must record at least the following details:\n- Name (of the account holder or service)\n- Username\n- Department\n- Role/account type (e.g., user, admin, service, third-party)\n- Date of access created\n- Last logon date\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure all accounts are tracked and managed to prevent unauthorized access.\n- Enable timely identification and removal of unused or unnecessary accounts.\n- Support accountability and traceability for access to organizational data and services.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nUntracked or unmanaged accounts are a common vector for cyberattacks. Maintaining a complete and current account inventory is a foundational control to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, privilege misuse, and account compromise, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides an account inventory list (e.g., spreadsheet, export from directory, or equivalent) that **explicitly includes all six required fields** for each account.\n- The list covers **all relevant account types**: user, administrator, third-party, and service accounts.\n- The inventory is **current** (updated within the last 3 months or as per organization policy).\n- Evidence demonstrates that the inventory is actively maintained (not a one-off or outdated snapshot).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The inventory list is missing **one or more required fields** for any account type.\n- The list **excludes** any account type (e.g., only user accounts, omitting service or third-party accounts).\n- The inventory is **outdated** (not updated within a reasonable timeframe).\n- No evidence of an account inventory is provided, or the evidence is clearly fabricated or generic.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The inventory includes most but not all required fields (e.g., missing \"last logon date\" for some accounts).\n- Some account types are present, but others are missing or not clearly identified.\n- The inventory is present but not clearly up-to-date.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence before making a final decision.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Account inventory list (spreadsheet, system export, or documented table).\n- Screenshots of account management systems showing required fields.\n- Policy or procedure documents describing how the inventory is maintained (optional but supportive).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be **specific to the organization** (not a template or example).\n- The list must be **legible, complete, and cover all required fields**.\n- The inventory should be **recent** (dated or showing recent logon activity).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Inventory is a generic template with no real data.\n- Fields are present as column headers but not populated.\n- List only includes user accounts, omitting admins, third-party, or service accounts.\n- Evidence is undated or clearly outdated.\n- Inconsistent or obviously fabricated data (e.g., all \"last logon dates\" are identical or blank).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- **Presence of all six required fields** for each account.\n- **Coverage of all account types** (user, admin, third-party, service).\n- **Evidence of regular updates** (recent \"last logon date\", recent \"date of access created\").\n- **Organization-specific data** (not a template).\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We maintain an Excel spreadsheet listing all accounts with columns for name, username, department, role/account type, date of access created, and last logon date. Attached is a redacted sample showing all fields populated for user, admin, and service accounts.\"\n- \"Our Active Directory export includes all required fields. See attached screenshot and export file.\"\n- \"We review and update the account inventory monthly. Here is the latest version from last month.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We have a list of users, but it does not include last logon date or account creation date.\"\n- \"We only track user accounts, not service or third-party accounts.\"\n- \"We do not keep an account inventory.\"\n- \"Here is a template we plan to use\" (with no actual data).\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide a recent version of the account inventory with all required fields populated?\"\n- \"How do you ensure service and third-party accounts are included in your inventory?\"\n- \"When was the inventory last updated?\"\n- \"How do you obtain the 'last logon date' for each account?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or table is acceptable, as long as all required fields and account types are covered.\n- For organizations with no third-party or service accounts, a statement confirming this is acceptable, but the inventory must still show all user/admin accounts.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual tracking is acceptable if automated tools are not available, provided the inventory is complete and up-to-date.\n- Reasonable effort means the organization should be able to produce the inventory within a few days of request.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have more complex account structures; ensure all relevant account types are considered.\n- For organizations using cloud services, ensure cloud-based accounts are included.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Missing service or third-party accounts.\n- Missing \"last logon date\" or \"date of access created\".\n- Inventory not updated regularly.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Providing only a template or policy, not the actual inventory.\n- Redacted samples that remove all meaningful data.\n- Evidence that is not organization-specific.\n\n### False Positives\n- Inventory appears complete but is outdated.\n- All fields present as headers but not populated.\n- Inventory only covers a subset of accounts.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is an account inventory provided?**\n   - No → **FAIL**\n   - Yes → Next step\n\n2. **Does the inventory include all six required fields for each account?**\n   - No → **FAIL**\n   - Yes → Next step\n\n3. **Are all account types (user, admin, third-party, service) included or explicitly accounted for?**\n   - No → **FAIL**\n   - Yes → Next step\n\n4. **Is the inventory current (updated within last 3 months or as per policy)?**\n   - No → **FAIL**\n   - Yes → **PASS**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or partially compliant, request clarification or additional evidence.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization cannot provide a satisfactory inventory or if there are concerns about evidence authenticity.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should ensure the organization provides a current, complete, and organization-specific account inventory covering all required fields and account types. Evidence must be credible and demonstrate active management of accounts. Partial or template-only responses are not sufficient. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but all must meet the baseline requirements for this provision.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must have a documented and consistently applied process for granting and revoking access to its data and services. This process must include necessary approvals (e.g., manager or HR sign-off) and be triggered by personnel changes such as onboarding, role changes, or departures. The process must capture, at minimum, the following information for each access request or change:\n\n- Name of the individual\n- System to be accessed\n- Department\n- Role/account type\n- From date (start of access)\n- To date (end of access, if applicable)\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure only authorized individuals have access to sensitive systems and data.\n- Prevent unauthorized access due to oversight or lack of process.\n- Enable timely revocation of access when staff leave or change roles.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nAccess control is a foundational security measure. Without a formal process, organizations risk data breaches from former employees or inappropriate access by current staff. This provision ensures accountability and traceability in access management, even in small or resource-limited organizations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- There is a documented process (policy, SOP, or workflow) for granting and revoking access, including necessary approvals.\n- The process is applied during onboarding, role changes, and offboarding.\n- Access requests/changes are recorded with all required fields (name, system, department, role/account type, from date, to date).\n- Evidence shows the process is in use (e.g., completed forms, approval emails, access logs).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No documented process exists, or process lacks required approvals.\n- Process does not cover both granting and revoking access.\n- Required fields are missing from records.\n- No evidence of process being followed (e.g., only verbal confirmation, no records).\n- Access is granted/revoked informally (e.g., via chat, without record or approval).\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Process exists but is inconsistently applied (e.g., only for some systems or staff).\n- Some, but not all, required fields are captured.\n- Evidence is incomplete or outdated.\n- Approvals are informal or not documented.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Access control policy or documented procedure (can be simple, e.g., a one-page SOP).\n- Sample access request/approval forms or emails (redacted if necessary).\n- Access logs or records showing required fields.\n- Evidence of recent onboarding/offboarding with completed process.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Must show actual use, not just templates.\n- Approvals should be traceable (e.g., manager/HR sign-off).\n- All required fields must be present in at least some records.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Only policy documents, no operational evidence.\n- Evidence is outdated or generic (e.g., blank forms).\n- Missing approvals or incomplete records.\n- Evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent with organization size/structure.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: Is there a formal process (with approvals) to grant and revoke access?\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Description of a step-by-step process.\n- Mention of who approves access (e.g., manager, HR).\n- Evidence of process being followed (forms, emails, logs).\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- \"We use an access request form that must be approved by the department head. When staff leave, HR notifies IT to revoke access. See attached sample forms and approval emails.\"\n- \"Access is granted via email request to IT, with manager approval required. Records are kept in a shared folder. See attached redacted samples.\"\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- \"We just tell IT when someone needs access.\"\n- \"There is no formal process, but we try to remember to remove access when people leave.\"\n- No evidence provided.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- \"Can you provide a recent example of an access request and approval?\"\n- \"How do you ensure access is revoked when staff leave?\"\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Is there an access-control policy?\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- Existence of a written policy or SOP (even if brief).\n- Policy describes approval and record-keeping requirements.\n- Policy covers both granting and revoking access.\n\n**Acceptable Responses:**\n- \"See attached access control policy, which outlines the approval process and required information.\"\n- \"Our SOP (attached) describes how access is managed for new hires and leavers.\"\n\n**Unacceptable Responses:**\n- \"We don't have a written policy.\"\n- \"Policy only covers granting, not revoking, access.\"\n- Policy is generic and not tailored to organization.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n- \"When was this policy last reviewed or updated?\"\n- \"How is the policy communicated to staff?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple spreadsheet or email trail is acceptable if it captures all required fields and approvals.\n- The process can be manual, but must be documented and consistently applied.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept simple, low-tech solutions (e.g., email approvals, shared folders) if they meet the requirements.\n- Do not require enterprise-level tools or automated systems.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For regulated sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance), expect more formal processes.\n- For micro-businesses, flexibility is allowed, but minimum fields and approvals must still be present.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Missing revocation process (focus only on granting access).\n- Incomplete records (missing required fields).\n- No evidence of approvals.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Only templates provided, no completed examples.\n- Outdated or irrelevant evidence.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy exists but is not followed in practice.\n- Evidence is staged or not representative of actual operations.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented process or policy for access control?**\n   - No → FAIL\n   - Yes → Continue\n\n2. **Does the process require approvals for granting/revoking access?**\n   - No → FAIL\n   - Yes → Continue\n\n3. **Are all required fields (name, system, department, role/account type, from/to dates) captured in records?**\n   - No → Partial/FAIL (depending on extent)\n   - Yes → Continue\n\n4. **Is there evidence the process is used for onboarding, role changes, and offboarding?**\n   - No → Partial/FAIL\n   - Yes → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, escalate to senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If organization claims process is \"in progress,\" mark as FAIL but provide guidance for remediation.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a documented, consistently applied process for access control, with necessary approvals and records capturing all required fields. Evidence must show actual use, not just intent. Flexibility is allowed for small organizations, but minimum standards must be met. Incomplete, informal, or undocumented processes should result in a FAIL or request for remediation.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that employees can only access the information and systems necessary for their specific job roles. This means access rights should be assigned based on job function (the principle of least privilege), and there should be controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive or unrelated data and services.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Minimize risk of data breaches or accidental data exposure.\n- Limit the impact of compromised accounts.\n- Ensure accountability and traceability of user actions.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nAccess control is a foundational cybersecurity measure. Without it, employees may inadvertently or maliciously access, modify, or leak sensitive information. For resource-constrained organizations, even simple access control practices (e.g., using built-in user groups, role-based permissions) can significantly reduce risk.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization has a documented or clearly described process for assigning access rights based on job roles.\n- Access to data and systems is restricted to only those who need it for their work.\n- There is evidence of periodic review or adjustment of access rights (e.g., when roles change or staff leave).\n- The self-assessment response demonstrates understanding and implementation of the principle of least privilege.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No process or policy exists for managing access based on job roles.\n- All or most employees have broad or unrestricted access to data/systems regardless of job function.\n- The organization cannot describe how access is controlled or reviewed.\n- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or contradicts the claim of restricted access.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- The organization has some access controls, but they are inconsistently applied or only cover certain systems.\n- The process is informal or ad hoc, with no documentation or clear assignment of responsibility.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing access controls but has not completed the process.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Access control policy or written procedure (even if brief or informal).\n- Screenshots or exports showing user permissions or group memberships.\n- Examples of user access requests/approvals or onboarding/offboarding checklists.\n- Records of periodic access reviews (e.g., email confirming review, checklist).\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence should be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Documentation should be specific to the organization (not generic templates).\n- Screenshots or lists should show actual user-role mappings or permissions.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or unrelated to the organization’s actual systems.\n- No evidence provided, or evidence does not match the described process.\n- Evidence shows all users have the same or excessive access.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Clear description of how access is granted, reviewed, and revoked.\n- Mention of role-based access, user groups, or similar mechanisms.\n- Evidence that access is limited and periodically reviewed.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “We assign access based on job roles using [system/tool]. Only finance staff can access financial data; only HR can access personnel files. We review access rights every 6 months.”\n- Screenshot of user group memberships showing separation by department.\n- Simple written policy stating: “Access to shared folders is restricted by department. Access is reviewed when staff change roles or leave.”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “Everyone can access everything.”\n- “We trust our staff to only look at what they need.”\n- “We don’t have a policy, but we think access is fine.”\n- No evidence or only a generic policy template with no organization-specific details.\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- How do you ensure that access rights are updated when someone changes roles or leaves?\n- Can you provide an example of how access is restricted for a specific department or role?\n- When was the last time you reviewed user access rights?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), informal processes may be acceptable if access is demonstrably limited and risks are low.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized controls and periodic reviews.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Written policies can be brief and simple.\n- Use of built-in access controls (e.g., Windows user groups, Google Workspace permissions) is acceptable.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should show stricter controls.\n- For less sensitive environments, proportional controls are acceptable if risks are addressed.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Overly broad access granted “for convenience.”\n- No process for removing access when staff leave.\n- Reliance on trust rather than controls.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Policies are generic, outdated, or not followed in practice.\n- Evidence does not match described processes.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Descriptions sound compliant but lack supporting evidence.\n- “Access is restricted” with no details or proof.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Is there a process or policy for access control based on job roles?**\n   - If YES, proceed to 2.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n2. **Is there evidence that access is restricted and periodically reviewed?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (if process is in progress or partially implemented).\n3. **Does the evidence match the described process and is it organization-specific?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or incomplete, request additional information.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for similar organization sizes and risk profiles.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical evidence that access to data and systems is limited to what employees need for their job roles, with processes in place for assigning, reviewing, and revoking access. Responses should be proportionate to the organization’s size and resources, but must demonstrate real, not just theoretical, access control.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4e  \n**Clause: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  \n**Provision Requirement:** Accounts with access rights that are no longer required or have exceeded the requested date shall have their access disabled or removed from the system. Shared, duplicate, obsolete and invalid accounts shall be removed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must have a process to promptly disable or remove user accounts (including employees, contractors, vendors, etc.) when access is no longer required—such as at the end of employment, contract, or project. Additionally, shared, duplicate, obsolete, or invalid accounts must be identified and removed to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches from dormant or forgotten accounts.\n- Ensure only current, authorized users have access.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nDormant or unnecessary accounts are a common attack vector for cybercriminals. Removing or disabling such accounts is a fundamental security hygiene practice, especially for organizations with limited resources, as it significantly reduces risk with minimal effort.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- There is a documented and consistently applied process for removing or disabling user accounts when access is no longer required (e.g., upon employee exit, contract end, or role change).\n- The process covers all types of accounts (staff, contractors, vendors, etc.).\n- There is evidence that shared, duplicate, obsolete, and invalid accounts are regularly identified and removed.\n- The process is implemented in practice, not just documented.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process exists, or the process is not documented or communicated.\n- The process is ad hoc, informal, or inconsistently applied.\n- Accounts remain active after users have left or no longer require access.\n- Shared, duplicate, or obsolete accounts are present and unmanaged.\n- No evidence of account reviews or removals.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- A process exists but is not consistently followed or lacks coverage for all account types.\n- Some evidence of account removal, but with gaps (e.g., only for full-time staff, not contractors).\n- Process is manual and prone to oversight, with no periodic review.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedures or checklists for offboarding and account removal.\n- Screenshots or logs showing recent account removals/disablements.\n- User account lists before and after offboarding events.\n- Records of periodic account reviews or audits.\n- Communication records (e.g., HR-IT handover emails).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Procedures should be clear, actionable, and tailored to the organization.\n- Evidence should demonstrate actual implementation, not just intent.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Outdated or generic procedures not reflecting current practice.\n- Evidence limited to policy documents with no proof of execution.\n- Account lists showing active users who have left the organization.\n- Lack of periodic review or audit records.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**\"Is there a process to remove access to data for employees who have reached the end of contract?\"**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Description of a clear, repeatable process for removing access.\n- Reference to both IT and HR involvement (e.g., HR notifies IT upon employee exit).\n- Evidence of recent account removals.\n- Mention of periodic account reviews for shared, duplicate, or obsolete accounts.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"Yes, when an employee leaves, HR notifies IT, and IT disables all accounts within 24 hours. We keep a checklist and review accounts monthly to remove any obsolete or duplicate accounts. See attached offboarding checklist and recent account removal logs.\"\n- \"We have a documented offboarding process. All user accounts are reviewed and removed upon contract end. Attached are screenshots of our user management system showing recent removals.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We usually remember to remove accounts when someone leaves.\"\n- \"We don't have many employees, so we just delete accounts when we notice.\"\n- \"No formal process, but IT handles it.\"\n- \"We have a policy, but no evidence of recent removals.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide a sample of a recent offboarding event and the corresponding account removal?\"\n- \"How do you ensure that shared or duplicate accounts are identified and removed?\"\n- \"How often do you review user accounts for validity?\"\n- \"Does your process cover contractors and temporary staff?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple checklist or manual process is acceptable, provided it is consistently applied and documented.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized procedures and periodic reviews.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Automated tools are not required; manual processes are acceptable if effective.\n- Evidence can be simple (e.g., annotated screenshots, basic checklists).\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with high staff turnover or many contractors should have more frequent reviews.\n- Sectors with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter controls.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Relying solely on memory or informal practices.\n- Overlooking non-employee accounts (contractors, vendors).\n- Failing to address shared or generic accounts.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Policies without proof of implementation.\n- Outdated or incomplete procedures.\n- Lack of evidence for recent account removals.\n\n### False Positives\n- Descriptions of intent without supporting evidence.\n- Evidence of a process for employees, but not for other account types.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented process for account removal?**\n   - If YES, proceed to 2.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the process consistently applied to all relevant account types?**\n   - If YES, proceed to 3.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL depending on scope.\n\n3. **Is there recent evidence of account removals and periodic reviews?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL.\n\n4. **Are shared, duplicate, obsolete, and invalid accounts addressed?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation.\n- If significant gaps or inconsistencies are found, escalate to a senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate a clear, consistently applied process for removing or disabling accounts when access is no longer required, with supporting evidence of recent implementation and coverage of all account types. Inadequate, informal, or undocumented processes, or lack of evidence, should result in a FAIL. Use practical judgment for small organizations, but require at least basic documentation and evidence of execution.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4f  \n**Clause**: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services  \n**Provision**: The administrator account shall only be accessed to perform administrator functions with approval from the senior management.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**Practical Requirement:**  \nThis provision requires that access to administrator (admin) accounts—those with elevated privileges to manage systems, data, or services—is strictly controlled. Specifically, admin accounts should only be used for admin tasks, and each instance of access must be approved by senior management (e.g., business owner, director, or equivalent).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized or unnecessary use of powerful admin accounts.\n- Ensure accountability and oversight for all admin-level activities.\n- Reduce risk of accidental or malicious changes to critical systems.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nAdmin accounts are a primary target for attackers and a common source of accidental misconfiguration. Requiring senior management approval for admin access ensures that such access is deliberate, justified, and monitored, which is critical for baseline security, especially in organizations with limited IT resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- There is a clear, documented process requiring senior management approval before admin accounts are accessed or used.\n- The process is known and followed by relevant staff.\n- Evidence (e.g., approval records, emails, logs) demonstrates that admin access is only granted after explicit senior management approval.\n- Admin accounts are not used for day-to-day activities; access is limited to necessary admin functions.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process exists for senior management approval of admin access.\n- Admin accounts are used routinely without oversight or approval.\n- Approval is informal, undocumented, or delegated to non-senior staff.\n- No evidence of approval or access control is provided.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- There is a process, but it is inconsistently applied or not documented.\n- Approval is sometimes obtained, but not always from senior management.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some admin access events.\n- Organization is in the process of implementing the requirement but has not fully operationalized it.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written policy or procedure describing the approval process for admin access.\n- Records of senior management approval (e.g., signed forms, approval emails, ticketing system logs).\n- Access logs showing admin account usage tied to approval events.\n- Staff communications or training records referencing the process.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months) and relevant to current practices.\n- Documentation should clearly identify who is considered \"senior management.\"\n- Approval records should be specific (who approved, for what purpose, when).\n- Evidence should cover all admin accounts in use.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague or generic statements without supporting documentation.\n- Evidence that is outdated, incomplete, or not specific to admin access.\n- Policies that mention approval but do not specify senior management involvement.\n- Approval records signed by IT staff or junior employees, not senior management.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**\"Is administrative access only granted with approval from senior management?\"**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Description of the approval process, including who approves and how approval is documented.\n- Examples of recent approval events.\n- Evidence that admin access is not used for routine tasks.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"All admin access requests are submitted to the Managing Director for approval via email. Access is only granted after written approval is received. See attached approval emails and access logs.\"\n- \"We have a policy requiring the owner to approve all admin access. Attached is the policy and a sample approval record from last month.\"\n- \"Admin accounts are disabled by default and only enabled temporarily with written approval from the CEO. See attached screenshots and approval records.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"Admin access is only used by IT staff as needed\" (no mention of senior management approval).\n- \"We trust our IT team to use admin accounts responsibly.\"\n- \"Approval is verbal and not documented.\"\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- Who in your organization is considered senior management for the purposes of admin access approval?\n- Can you provide a recent example of an admin access request and the corresponding approval?\n- How is the approval recorded and retained?\n- How do you ensure that admin accounts are not used for non-admin tasks?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), \"senior management\" may be the business owner or director. Approval can be via simple documented email or signed note.\n- For sole proprietors, self-approval is not meaningful; instead, ensure admin accounts are only used when necessary and access is logged.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- A simple, documented process (e.g., an email trail or approval log) is sufficient; complex systems are not required.\n- Approval can be manual and informal, as long as it is documented and involves senior management.\n\n### Industry Context\n- In regulated sectors, more formal approval processes may be expected.\n- For organizations with outsourced IT, ensure the approval process includes oversight by the organization's own senior management, not just the IT vendor.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming IT staff approval is sufficient.\n- Lack of documentation for approval events.\n- Admin accounts used for daily operations without restriction.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Policies that are generic or not tailored to the organization.\n- Missing or outdated approval records.\n- Evidence that does not clearly link approval to admin access events.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating that approval is required but providing no evidence.\n- Policies that mention approval but do not specify who approves or how.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented process requiring senior management approval for admin access?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Is there evidence that this process is followed (e.g., approval records, logs)?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and clearly involves senior management?**\n   - **No** → Partial Compliance (request more evidence or clarification)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or approval authority is unclear, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.\n- If the organization claims to be in transition (e.g., implementing a new process), assess for partial compliance and set a follow-up review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for what constitutes \"senior management\" and \"documented approval\" across all organizations of similar size and structure.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, documented, and consistently applied process requiring senior management approval for all admin account access, supported by recent and specific evidence. Responses lacking documentation, relying on IT staff approval, or providing only generic statements should be marked as FAIL. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but always require some form of documented oversight by the most senior person(s) in the organization.",

Such access shall be removed once they no longer require them.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that any third-party or contractor (e.g., vendors, outsourced IT, consultants) is only granted access to the specific information and systems necessary for their work. This access must be revoked promptly when it is no longer needed (e.g., upon contract completion or project end).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized or excessive access by external parties.\n- Minimize risk of data leakage, misuse, or compromise from third parties.\n- Ensure timely removal of access to reduce attack surface.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nThird parties are a common source of breaches due to over-permissive or lingering access. This provision ensures that organizations maintain control over who can access sensitive data and systems, and that such access is strictly limited and temporary.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a clear process for granting third-party/contractor access based on job requirements (principle of least privilege).\n- There is a documented or described method for removing access promptly when no longer needed.\n- Evidence shows that access is reviewed and removed in a timely manner.\n- The organization can provide at least one example of access being granted and later removed for a third party or contractor.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process exists for limiting or removing third-party/contractor access.\n- Access is granted broadly or indefinitely without review.\n- The organization cannot demonstrate any instance of access removal.\n- Responses are vague, generic, or indicate “full access” is given to all third parties.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The process is informal or ad hoc, but some evidence of access limitation and removal exists.\n- Access is limited, but removal is not timely or is inconsistently applied.\n- The organization is aware of the need but lacks documentation or consistent practice.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Access request/approval forms or emails for third parties/contractors.\n- Screenshots or logs showing user account creation and deactivation.\n- Written procedures or policies (even if brief) describing access management for third parties.\n- Example list of current or past third-party accounts and their status.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Documentation should be specific to third-party/contractor access, not just general access control.\n- Screenshots/logs should clearly show user/account names and access removal actions.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to third parties.\n- No proof of access removal (e.g., only access granting is shown).\n- Policies are copied from templates with no organization-specific details.\n- Evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent with described practices.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question:  \n**Is third-party or contractor access limited to required information and systems, and removed when no longer needed?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Description of how access is requested, approved, and provisioned for third parties.\n- Explanation of how access is restricted to only necessary systems/data.\n- Steps taken to remove access when the engagement ends.\n- Examples or records of access removal.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “We create separate accounts for each contractor, limited to the project folder and relevant application. When the contract ends, we disable their account within 24 hours. For example, Vendor X’s account was disabled after project Y ended.”\n- “Third-party access is approved by the IT manager and limited to the required server. Access is removed immediately after the work is completed, as shown in the attached access log.”\n- “We maintain a spreadsheet of all third-party accounts and review it monthly to ensure only active contractors have access.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “All contractors use the same admin account as staff.”\n- “We don’t track when contractors leave, so access is not removed.”\n- “Third parties have access to everything because it’s easier.”\n- “No third parties have access” (if evidence or business context suggests otherwise).\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide an example of a third-party account that was removed in the last 12 months?\n- How do you ensure that access is limited to only what is needed?\n- Who is responsible for removing third-party access, and how is this tracked?\n- How quickly is access removed after it is no longer needed?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, informal processes (e.g., email approvals, manual account disabling) are acceptable if consistently applied and evidenced.\n- A simple spreadsheet or checklist is sufficient for tracking access if formal systems are not in place.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Written procedures can be brief and practical; formal policies are not required.\n- Manual processes are acceptable if they are consistently followed and evidenced.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations in regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require stricter controls.\n- For organizations with no third-party access, ensure this is justified by business context and not used to avoid compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Failing to remove access after contract/project completion.\n- Granting excessive or blanket access to all third parties.\n- No tracking or review of third-party accounts.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence for access removal.\n- Policies that are not implemented in practice.\n- Evidence that does not distinguish between staff and third-party access.\n\n### False Positives\n- Descriptions of access control without any supporting evidence.\n- “We trust our contractors” as justification for not limiting access.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Does the organization have a process (formal or informal) for limiting third-party/contractor access to only what is required?**\n   - If YES, proceed.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n2. **Is there evidence that access is removed when no longer needed?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n3. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and credible?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n4. **If the process is informal but consistently applied and evidenced, is it proportionate to organization size?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or inconsistent, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims no third-party access, but business context suggests otherwise, seek clarification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical evidence that third-party/contractor access is both limited and removed when no longer needed. Accept informal but consistent processes for small organizations, but require specific, recent evidence of both access limitation and removal. Reject vague, generic, or unevidenced claims. Escalate unclear cases and ensure consistent application of criteria across all assessments.",

The NDA must explicitly state disciplinary actions or consequences for breaching the agreement.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive organizational data by external parties.\n- Establish legal and procedural recourse in the event of a data leak.\n- Ensure third parties understand their obligations and the seriousness of data protection.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nThird parties and contractors often present a significant risk vector for data leakage. This provision ensures a basic legal safeguard is in place, even for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources, by requiring a formal NDA process that includes clear consequences for violations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has an NDA template or form specifically for third parties/contractors.\n- The NDA includes explicit clauses about disciplinary actions or consequences for breaches (e.g., contract termination, legal action, financial penalties).\n- The organization can demonstrate that all relevant third parties/contractors have signed the NDA before accessing sensitive information.\n- Evidence is current (within the last 12 months or since the last onboarding of a third party).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No NDA exists for third parties/contractors.\n- The NDA does not mention disciplinary actions or consequences for breaches.\n- The organization cannot provide evidence that NDAs are signed by relevant third parties/contractors.\n- The NDA is outdated, unsigned, or not relevant to current third-party engagements.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- An NDA exists but lacks explicit disciplinary action clauses.\n- Only some third parties/contractors have signed the NDA.\n- The NDA is generic and not tailored to sensitive information or data protection.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of third-party relationships.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Copy of the NDA template/form used for third parties/contractors.\n- Signed NDA samples (with sensitive details redacted if necessary).\n- List of third parties/contractors with corresponding NDA status.\n- Onboarding checklist or process documentation referencing NDA signing.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- NDA must clearly reference data protection and disciplinary actions.\n- Signatures/dates must be visible (redacted names are acceptable for privacy).\n- Evidence should be recent and reflect current third-party relationships.\n\n### Red Flags\n- NDAs missing disciplinary action clauses.\n- Evidence of unsigned or undated NDAs.\n- NDAs that are not specific to third parties/contractors.\n- No mapping between third-party access and NDA coverage.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### What to Look For\n- Existence of an NDA form for third parties/contractors.\n- NDA content includes disciplinary action(s) for breaches.\n- Confirmation that all relevant third parties/contractors have signed the NDA.\n- Evidence is up-to-date and relevant to current third-party engagements.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"Yes, we have an NDA template for all contractors and third parties.

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4i  \n**Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services**  \n**Provision Requirement:** Physical access control shall be enforced to allow only authorised employees/contractors to access the organisation’s IT assets and/or environment, e.g., use of cable lock to lock the workstations and card access door lock to authenticate and authorise entry.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must implement and enforce physical access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel (employees or contractors) can physically access IT assets (e.g., servers, workstations, networking equipment) and the environments where these assets are located (e.g., server rooms, offices). Examples include card-access door locks, cable locks for workstations, locked cabinets, or other physical barriers.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized physical access to IT assets, reducing risk of theft, tampering, or data compromise.\n- Ensure accountability for physical access to sensitive areas or devices.\n- Deter opportunistic or malicious physical attacks.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nPhysical access is a foundational security control. Even with strong digital protections, physical access can allow attackers to bypass technical controls. This is especially critical for small organizations that may not have dedicated security staff or advanced monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has implemented at least one effective physical access control for all areas where IT assets are located.\n- Only authorized personnel (employees/contractors) can access these areas/assets.\n- Controls are appropriate for the environment (e.g., card access for office doors, cable locks for laptops, locked cabinets for networking equipment).\n- The organization can describe how access is granted, revoked, and monitored.\n- Evidence (if provided) supports the existence and use of these controls.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No physical access controls are in place for IT assets or environments.\n- Access is unrestricted or open to the public/unauthorized individuals.\n- Controls are described but not enforced (e.g., “we have a lock, but it’s never used”).\n- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or contradicts the self-assessment.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some, but not all, IT assets/environments are protected.\n- Controls exist but are inconsistently applied or poorly maintained.\n- The organization relies solely on informal or ad-hoc measures (e.g., “staff are told not to let strangers in”).\n- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine adequacy.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Photos of physical controls (e.g., card readers, cable locks, locked doors/cabinets).\n- Access control policies or procedures.\n- Access logs or records (if available).\n- Asset inventory showing location and protection measures.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Photos should clearly show the control in use.\n- Policies/procedures should be specific to physical access, not generic.\n- Evidence should match the description in the self-assessment.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Stock or internet photos instead of actual site photos.\n- Outdated or generic policies with no mention of physical controls.\n- Descriptions of controls that are not supported by evidence.\n- Evidence that shows controls are present but not used (e.g., unlocked doors in photos).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear description of physical access controls in place for all IT assets/environments.\n- Identification of who is authorized and how authorization is managed.\n- Evidence that controls are implemented and used in practice.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “All office doors are secured with card-access locks. Only employees and authorized contractors have cards. Server room is locked and only IT staff have keys. Laptops are secured with cable locks when not in use. See attached photos of card readers and cable locks.”\n- “Workstations are kept in a locked office. Only staff have keys. Network equipment is stored in a locked cabinet. Policy attached.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We trust our staff not to let strangers in.”\n- “The office is usually locked, but sometimes left open for deliveries.”\n- “No physical controls, but we have antivirus software.”\n- “We plan to install locks next year.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Which areas/assets are protected by physical access controls?\n- How is access granted and revoked for employees/contractors?\n- Are there any IT assets not protected by physical controls? Why?\n- Can you provide photos or documentation of the controls in use?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a single locked office door may suffice if all IT assets are inside and only staff have keys.\n- Home-based businesses: evidence of locked home office or secure storage for business IT assets is acceptable.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Expensive solutions (e.g., biometric readers) are not required; basic locks, cable locks, or locked cabinets are sufficient if used consistently.\n- Reasonable effort means using available, practical controls to restrict access.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Retail or public-facing businesses: back-office or IT storage areas must be physically secured, even if the front area is public.\n- Co-working/shared spaces: organization must demonstrate how their assets are secured (e.g., locked drawers, portable device locks).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming digital controls (passwords, firewalls) are sufficient without physical controls.\n- Only securing some assets (e.g., server but not workstations).\n- Relying on informal practices (“staff are vigilant”) instead of enforceable controls.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence or outdated photos/policies.\n- Policies that mention physical security but do not specify actual controls in use.\n\n### False Positives\n- Descriptions of controls that are not actually implemented.\n- Evidence of controls in place but not used (e.g., keys left in locks, doors propped open).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are physical access controls implemented for all IT assets/environments?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Are controls enforced and only authorized personnel have access?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is there credible evidence supporting the implementation and use of controls?**\n   - **No** → Partial/FAIL (request more evidence)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or missing, request additional information.\n- If controls are only partially implemented, escalate to senior auditor for risk-based decision.\n- If organization claims controls are “in progress,” mark as FAIL until implemented.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size or context.\n- Document rationale for decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical, and enforced physical access controls protecting all IT assets/environments, supported by credible evidence. Responses must demonstrate that only authorized personnel can access these assets, with controls appropriate to the organization’s size and context. Incomplete, informal, or unsubstantiated responses should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must review user accounts at least every three months (quarterly) and additionally whenever there are significant changes to personnel or organizational structure (e.g., onboarding, offboarding, restructuring). The goal is to ensure only authorized users have access to systems and data, and that access is revoked promptly when no longer needed.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access by removing or updating accounts as roles change.\n- Minimize risk from orphaned, unused, or excessive privilege accounts.\n- Ensure access rights reflect current organizational needs.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nRegular account reviews are a fundamental control to prevent data breaches and insider threats. They are especially critical for small organizations where informal processes may lead to oversight. This provision ensures that access is actively managed, not just set-and-forget.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Organization states that account reviews are conducted **at least quarterly** (every 3 months).\n- Organization also reviews accounts **during onboarding/offboarding** or after organizational changes.\n- There is evidence of a **repeatable process** (e.g., checklist, calendar reminders, or documented procedure).\n- If evidence is provided, it shows **recent reviews** (within the last quarter).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Reviews are conducted **less frequently than quarterly** (e.g., annually, ad hoc, or only when issues arise).\n- No mention of reviews during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes.\n- No process or evidence of reviews.\n- Responses indicate reviews are “planned” but not yet implemented.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Reviews are conducted, but **not as frequently as required** (e.g., semi-annually).\n- Reviews are only done during onboarding/offboarding, not on a regular schedule.\n- Process exists but is **not consistently followed** (e.g., missed recent quarters).\n- Evidence is incomplete or outdated (e.g., last review was over 3 months ago).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Account review logs or checklists (manual or digital).\n- Calendar invites/reminders for scheduled reviews.\n- Email records or meeting notes referencing account reviews.\n- Written procedures or policies describing the review process.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last quarter).\n- Should show **who conducted the review**, **when**, and **what was checked**.\n- Evidence should be **specific** (not generic statements or templates).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated or not tied to actual reviews.\n- Evidence is a policy only, with no proof of execution.\n- Evidence is outdated (older than 3 months).\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical checklists for multiple periods).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question: **How often are account reviews carried out?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Clear statement of review frequency (e.g., “quarterly” or “every 3 months”).\n- Mention of reviews during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes.\n- Description of the process (who, how, what is reviewed).\n- Supporting evidence as described above.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “We conduct account reviews every quarter and whenever staff join, leave, or change roles. We use a checklist and keep records in our shared drive.”\n- “Account reviews are scheduled every 3 months. We also review accounts during onboarding and offboarding. See attached review logs for the last two quarters.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We review accounts once a year.”\n- “We review accounts when we remember or when someone leaves.”\n- “We plan to start quarterly reviews soon.”\n- “We have a policy, but no records of actual reviews.”\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide evidence of your most recent account review?”\n- “How do you ensure reviews happen on schedule?”\n- “Who is responsible for conducting the reviews?”\n- “What steps are taken if an account is found to be unnecessary?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet or checklist is acceptable.\n- The process can be informal but must be **documented and repeatable**.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Automated tools are not required; manual reviews are acceptable.\n- Reasonable effort means at least a basic record of reviews and actions taken.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with high staff turnover or sensitive data may need more frequent or detailed reviews.\n- For sectors with regulatory requirements, ensure alignment with those standards.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Confusing onboarding/offboarding with regular reviews (must do both).\n- Reviews are claimed but not documented.\n- Reviews are performed only after incidents, not proactively.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Only policies provided, no proof of execution.\n- Evidence is outdated or incomplete.\n- No clear assignment of responsibility.\n\n### False Positives\n- Vague statements (“We review regularly”) without specifics or evidence.\n- Templates or checklists with no dates or signatures.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence of account reviews at least quarterly?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Are reviews also conducted during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification).\n\n3. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and credible?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on severity).\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or inconsistent, request additional documentation.\n- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes frequency requirements or provides conflicting information.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for size and reasonable resource constraints.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate (with credible evidence) that account reviews are conducted at least quarterly and during onboarding/offboarding or organizational changes. The process should be documented, repeatable, and recent. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept ad hoc or undocumented practices.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must have a process to identify user accounts (including staff, contractors, and service accounts) that have not been used for a prolonged period (suggested: 60 days) and ensure such accounts are either removed or disabled in a timely manner.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Minimize the risk of unauthorized access via forgotten or unused accounts.\n- Reduce the attack surface by ensuring only active, necessary accounts exist.\n- Prevent exploitation of dormant accounts by malicious actors.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nDormant accounts are a common target for attackers, as they are often overlooked and may not be monitored. Removing or disabling these accounts is a fundamental access control measure that significantly reduces risk, especially for organizations with limited resources and expertise.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a documented and implemented process to identify and remove/disable accounts inactive for a defined period (ideally 60 days, but up to 90 days may be acceptable for small organizations).\n- The process covers all relevant systems (e.g., email, file servers, cloud services, business applications).\n- Evidence shows the process is followed in practice (e.g., recent account review logs, screenshots, or policy documents).\n- The process is applied consistently, not just ad hoc.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process exists, or the process is only informal/verbal with no supporting evidence.\n- The process is not implemented (e.g., accounts remain active indefinitely regardless of use).\n- The inactivity threshold is unreasonably long (e.g., >180 days) without justification.\n- The process only covers some systems, leaving significant gaps.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The process exists but is inconsistently applied or only covers some systems.\n- The inactivity threshold is slightly longer than 60 days (e.g., 90 days) but justified by business needs.\n- Evidence is incomplete or outdated, requiring clarification or additional documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedures or policy documents describing the process.\n- Screenshots of account management tools showing inactive account identification.\n- Logs or reports from recent account reviews (redacted as needed).\n- Examples of disabled/removed accounts with dates.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 6–12 months).\n- Documentation should be clear, specific, and relevant to the organization’s actual systems.\n- Screenshots/logs should demonstrate real activity, not just templates.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or unrelated to the organization’s environment.\n- No proof of actual account removals/disabling.\n- Policy exists but no evidence of implementation.\n- Evidence appears fabricated or copied from online sources.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear description of the process for identifying and handling inactive accounts.\n- Defined inactivity threshold (ideally 60 days, up to 90 days with justification).\n- List of systems covered by the process.\n- Evidence of recent account reviews and actions taken.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We run a monthly report from our Active Directory to identify accounts inactive for 60 days. These are reviewed and disabled by the IT administrator. Attached are screenshots of our last review and a copy of our access control policy.”\n- “Our cloud service provider automatically disables accounts after 60 days of inactivity. Here is a screenshot of the configuration and a log of recent disabled accounts.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We don’t have many users, so we don’t need this.”\n- “We remove accounts when someone tells us to.”\n- “We have a policy, but no evidence of it being followed.”\n- “We only check email accounts, not other systems.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Which systems are included in your inactive account review process?\n- How often is the review conducted?\n- Can you provide a recent example of an account that was disabled or removed due to inactivity?\n- How is the process documented and communicated to relevant staff?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple manual review process is acceptable if documented and performed regularly.\n- Automated tools are not required, but the process must be demonstrable.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means a periodic (e.g., monthly or quarterly) manual check is sufficient for small teams.\n- The inactivity threshold can be up to 90 days if justified by business needs.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with high staff turnover or sensitive data may require stricter controls.\n- For sectors with regulatory requirements, ensure alignment with those standards.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only some systems are covered (e.g., email but not cloud storage).\n- No regular review schedule—only ad hoc removals.\n- Inactivity threshold is undefined or too long.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Policies are generic or not tailored to the organization.\n- No evidence of actual account removals/disabling.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy exists but no proof of implementation.\n- Evidence is staged for the audit, not part of regular practice.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a documented process for identifying and removing/disabling inactive accounts?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n2. **Is the inactivity threshold defined and reasonable (≤90 days)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL (unless strong justification)\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n3. **Is the process applied to all relevant systems?**\n   - If NO → Partial/FAIL (depending on risk)\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n4. **Is there recent evidence of the process being followed?**\n   - If NO → Partial/FAIL\n   - If YES → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims alternative controls or business justifications that are not standard.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same threshold for evidence and process rigor across similar organizations.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, documented, and implemented process for identifying and removing or disabling dormant accounts across all relevant systems, with evidence of recent activity. The process should be proportionate to the organization’s size and resources but must be real and effective. Incomplete, ad hoc, or undocumented approaches should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.",

Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshot of password policy settings from IT systems (e.g., Windows Group Policy, cloud admin console).\n- Excerpts from written password policy documents.\n- Sample screenshots showing password creation/change screens enforcing requirements.\n- Change logs or records showing default passwords were updated.\n- Statements from IT staff confirming procedures.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Screenshots must clearly show relevant settings (e.g., minimum length, complexity).\n- Written policies must be officially adopted and in use.\n- Evidence should cover all relevant systems (not just a single device).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not organization-specific.\n- Screenshots are cropped or do not show relevant settings.\n- Policies are aspirational (“we plan to...”) rather than implemented.\n- No mention of changing default passwords.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that all default passwords have been changed.\n- Description or screenshot of password policy enforcing:\n  - Minimum 12 characters\n  - Upper/lower case and/or special characters\n- Evidence that policy is applied to all user and admin accounts.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We have changed all default passwords on our routers, servers, and applications. Our password policy requires at least 12 characters, including upper and lower case letters and special characters. See attached screenshot of our policy settings.”\n- Screenshot from admin console showing password policy settings.\n- Written policy excerpt with date of adoption and scope.\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We tell staff to use strong passwords, but do not enforce it.”\n- “Most passwords are strong, but some systems still use defaults.”\n- “Our passwords are at least 8 characters.”\n- No evidence provided, or evidence does not mention default password changes.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide evidence that default passwords have been changed on all devices?\n- Is the password policy enforced technically, or just communicated to staff?\n- Are there any exceptions to the policy? If so, why?\n- When was the password policy last reviewed or updated?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), written policies may be informal, but technical enforcement (e.g., device settings) is still expected.\n- Manual processes may be acceptable if documented and consistently applied.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept simple, clear evidence (e.g., screenshots, short policy statements) rather than extensive documentation.\n- Allow for basic technical controls if advanced tools are not available.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For organizations with specialized devices (e.g., IoT, POS), ensure default credentials are changed even if device limitations exist.\n- For cloud-based organizations, check password policies in cloud admin portals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking non-IT devices (e.g., printers, routers) that retain default passwords.\n- Policy exists but is not enforced in practice.\n- Password length or complexity requirements are below standard.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is not organization-specific.\n- Screenshots do not show relevant settings.\n- Policy documents are undated or not in use.\n\n### False Positives\n- Statements of intent (“we plan to...”) without proof of implementation.\n- Evidence from only one system when multiple are in use.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Has the organization changed all default passwords?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Is there a password policy requiring at least 12 characters and complexity?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Is the policy enforced (technically or procedurally) and evidence provided?**\n   - If YES → PASS\n   - If evidence is incomplete or unclear → Partial, request more info\n   - If NO → FAIL\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or only partially covers systems, escalate to senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for all organizations of similar size and IT complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that all default passwords have been changed and that a password policy enforcing at least 12 characters with complexity is in place and applied. Accept practical, proportionate evidence, but do not accept generic statements or policies that are not implemented. Escalate or request more information if responses are unclear or incomplete.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must implement technical controls that automatically disable or lock user accounts after a defined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 10). Alternatively, they may implement mechanisms that slow (‘throttle’) repeated login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access via brute-force password guessing.\n- Detect and respond to abnormal login activity.\n- Limit the risk of account compromise due to weak or reused passwords.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nThis is a foundational security control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources. It is a common attack vector and a basic expectation for any system handling sensitive or business-critical data.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a technical control in place that:\n  - Automatically disables or locks user accounts after a set number of failed login attempts (ideally 10 or fewer).\n  - OR, implements login throttling to slow down repeated failed attempts.\n- The control is enabled and enforced for all user accounts on all relevant systems (e.g., endpoints, servers, cloud services, business applications).\n- The organization can demonstrate or describe how this control is configured and monitored.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No technical control exists to lock or disable accounts after failed login attempts.\n- The control is only partially implemented (e.g., only on some systems, or only for admin accounts).\n- The organization relies solely on manual monitoring or post-incident response.\n- The organization cannot describe or provide evidence of the control.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The control is implemented on some, but not all, systems or accounts.\n- The lockout threshold is set unreasonably high (e.g., more than 20 attempts) or is not clearly defined.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing the control but it is not yet fully in place.\n- The organization uses alternative controls (e.g., login throttling) but cannot clearly explain or evidence their effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of account lockout policy settings from operating systems, directory services (e.g., Active Directory), or cloud admin consoles.\n- Policy documents or configuration guides showing lockout/throttling settings.\n- System logs or reports showing account lockout events.\n- Descriptions of how the control is implemented and monitored.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Screenshots must clearly show relevant settings (e.g., number of failed attempts, lockout duration).\n- Policy documents must be organization-specific, not generic templates.\n- Descriptions must be specific to the organization’s environment.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is missing, outdated, or generic.\n- Screenshots are cropped, unclear, or do not show relevant settings.\n- Policies are not enforced or are only aspirational.\n- The organization cannot explain how the control works in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**IT: Are there endpoint controls to detect abnormal account access (e.g., multiple failed logins, logins at odd hours)?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Clear description of technical controls that detect and respond to multiple failed login attempts.\n- Mention of account lockout or login throttling features.\n- Evidence that these controls are enabled and enforced.\n- Coverage across all relevant systems (not just a subset).\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “We have configured Windows Group Policy to lock accounts after 10 failed login attempts. See attached screenshot.”\n- “Our cloud service (e.g., Microsoft 365) automatically locks accounts after 10 failed attempts. See admin console screenshot.”\n- “We use endpoint security software that detects and blocks repeated failed login attempts. See configuration guide.”\n- “We have login throttling enabled on our web portal, which slows down repeated failed attempts.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We monitor login attempts manually and respond if we see something suspicious.”\n- “We don’t have this control, but we plan to implement it in the future.”\n- “Our users are trained to use strong passwords, so this is not necessary.”\n- “We only lock accounts for admin users, not regular staff.”\n- No evidence or only generic policy statements.\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide a screenshot or policy document showing the lockout/throttling configuration?”\n- “Is this control applied to all user accounts and systems, or only some?”\n- “How do you monitor or get notified when an account is locked out?”\n- “When was this control last tested or reviewed?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), controls may be implemented via built-in OS settings or cloud service defaults.\n- Manual monitoring is not sufficient; some automated control is required, even if basic.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or built-in controls (e.g., Windows Group Policy, cloud admin settings) are acceptable.\n- Third-party tools are not required if built-in controls are used effectively.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with regulatory requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare) may need stricter thresholds.\n- For organizations with only cloud-based systems, evidence should focus on cloud admin settings.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Control only applied to admin accounts, not all users.\n- Lockout threshold set too high (e.g., 50 attempts).\n- Control not enabled on all systems (e.g., only on desktops, not laptops or cloud services).\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots or policies are outdated or not organization-specific.\n- Evidence does not clearly show lockout/throttling settings.\n\n### False Positives\n- Descriptions that sound compliant but lack supporting evidence.\n- Policies that are not actually enforced in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a technical control that locks/disables accounts or throttles login attempts after multiple failures?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n2. **Is the control enabled and enforced for all user accounts and relevant systems?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification or evidence)\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n3. **Is there credible, current evidence (e.g., screenshots, policy documents) showing the control is in place?**\n   - **No:** FAIL (unless partial compliance and evidence can be provided)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional information.\n- If the organization claims alternative controls, escalate to a senior auditor for review.\n- If partial compliance is identified, document gaps and request remediation plan or timeline.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, regardless of size, unless justified by documented resource constraints.\n- Ensure that evidence is reviewed for all relevant systems (endpoints, servers, cloud).\n- Document rationale for each decision to support consistent future assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, current evidence that user accounts are automatically locked or login attempts are throttled after multiple failures, covering all relevant systems. Manual processes or incomplete coverage are not sufficient. Responses must be specific, supported by evidence, and reflect actual practice, not just policy intent. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but require at least basic automated controls. Escalate unclear or borderline cases for further review.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that whenever there is a suspicion or confirmation that an account password has been compromised (e.g., through phishing, malware, or unauthorized access), the password for that account is promptly changed. This should be reflected in the organization’s password policy and operational procedures.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent continued unauthorized access after a compromise.\n- Limit the window of opportunity for attackers.\n- Ensure compromised credentials are rendered useless as soon as possible.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nPassword compromise is a common attack vector. Promptly changing passwords upon suspicion of compromise is a fundamental, low-cost, high-impact control that significantly reduces risk, especially for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization’s password policy **explicitly states** that passwords must be changed immediately upon suspected or confirmed compromise.\n- There is a **clear, actionable process** for identifying and responding to suspected password compromise.\n- Staff are **aware** of this requirement (e.g., through training or policy dissemination).\n- Evidence (if provided) supports that this process is in place and has been communicated.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The password policy **does not mention** password changes in the event of compromise.\n- The organization’s response is vague, generic, or only references periodic password changes (e.g., “we change passwords every 90 days”).\n- No process or awareness of what to do in the event of a suspected compromise.\n- No evidence or only irrelevant evidence provided.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The policy mentions password changes but **only after confirmed compromise**, not suspicion.\n- The process is informal or ad-hoc (e.g., “we tell IT if something seems wrong” without documented steps).\n- The organization relies solely on users to self-report without any supporting guidance or reminders.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Password policy document or excerpt.\n- Incident response or access control procedures referencing password resets.\n- Staff communications or training materials mentioning password change requirements.\n- Screenshots of policy documents, intranet pages, or email communications.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be **current** (within the last 12 months).\n- Policy/procedure must **explicitly reference** password changes upon suspected compromise.\n- Evidence should be **organization-specific** (not generic templates).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Outdated policies (older than 12 months, or no review date).\n- Generic policy templates with no customization.\n- Evidence that only covers routine password changes, not compromise scenarios.\n- No evidence provided when requested.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**IT: Does the password policy account for the password reset of a compromised account?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Direct reference in the policy to password resets upon suspected or confirmed compromise.\n- Description of how staff are made aware of this requirement.\n- Evidence that the process is known and actionable.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “Our password policy states that any account suspected of being compromised must have its password changed immediately. This is communicated to all staff during onboarding and in our annual security refresher.”\n- “If we suspect an account has been compromised, our IT support resets the password and notifies the user. This is outlined in our access control procedure (see attached excerpt).”\n- Attached policy document with a highlighted section: “In the event of suspected compromise, the password must be changed immediately.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We change passwords every 90 days.”\n- “We don’t have a formal process, but staff know to tell IT if something is wrong.”\n- “We have never had a compromise, so this is not applicable.”\n- No supporting evidence or only a generic password policy with no mention of compromise.\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide the section of your policy that covers password changes after suspected compromise?”\n- “How are staff informed of what to do if they suspect their account is compromised?”\n- “When was the last time this process was reviewed or communicated to staff?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple, clearly communicated process (e.g., an email to all staff outlining the steps) is acceptable if formal documentation is not feasible.\n- The key is that **all staff know what to do** and that the process is actionable.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- A basic written policy or procedure is sufficient; complex technical solutions are not required.\n- Evidence of communication (e.g., a staff memo or onboarding checklist) is acceptable.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For sectors with higher risk (e.g., finance, healthcare), expect more formalization.\n- For low-risk sectors, a simple, clear process is acceptable as long as it meets the intent.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Policy only covers routine password changes, not compromise scenarios.\n- Over-reliance on informal or verbal processes.\n- Staff are unaware of what to do in case of suspected compromise.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated or generic policies.\n- No evidence of staff awareness or communication.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy mentions “password changes” but not specifically in response to compromise.\n- Evidence provided is a template with no organization-specific details.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Does the policy/procedure explicitly require password change upon suspected compromise?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is there evidence that this requirement is communicated and actionable (e.g., staff awareness, process steps)?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial compliance; request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n3. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial compliance or FAIL depending on severity.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If the response is ambiguous, lacks evidence, or appears to be a template, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and sector.\n- Document rationale for decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must have a policy or process that explicitly requires password changes upon suspected compromise, and there must be evidence that this is known and actionable by staff. Routine password changes or informal processes are insufficient. Evidence must be current, organization-specific, and clearly demonstrate compliance with the provision.",

Organisations may implement this in different ways, e.g., use of an authenticator application on the mobile or one-time password (OTP) token.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must implement two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for administrative access to important systems—especially those that are Internet-facing and/or contain sensitive or business-critical data. This means that, in addition to a password, a second authentication factor (such as an OTP, authenticator app, or hardware token) is required for admin logins.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized administrative access, even if passwords are compromised.\n- Reduce risk of breaches on critical systems.\n- Protect sensitive and business-critical data from common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, credential stuffing).\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nAdministrative accounts are high-value targets. 2FA is a proven, practical control that significantly raises the bar for attackers, especially for organizations with limited resources. This is a baseline expectation for Internet-facing and sensitive systems.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- 2FA/MFA is enabled for all administrative accounts on all important systems (especially Internet-facing or those with sensitive/business-critical data).\n- The organization can clearly identify which systems are covered and describe the 2FA method(s) used (e.g., authenticator app, OTP, hardware token).\n- Evidence (screenshots, policy, configuration) supports the claim that 2FA is in place and enforced for admin access.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- 2FA/MFA is not implemented for administrative access to important systems.\n- The organization cannot identify which systems require 2FA, or claims it is “not feasible” without justification.\n- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or shows 2FA is not enforced for admin accounts.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- 2FA is implemented on some, but not all, important systems or admin accounts.\n- 2FA is only enabled for user (not admin) accounts.\n- The organization claims technical or business constraints prevent full implementation, but does not provide a reasonable risk-based justification or compensating controls.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of admin login prompts showing 2FA/MFA requirement.\n- Configuration settings from admin portals (e.g., cloud console, server admin panel) showing 2FA enabled.\n- Policy documents or procedures mandating 2FA for admin access.\n- List of important systems with 2FA status.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 3 months).\n- Screenshots must clearly show the system, user role (admin), and 2FA prompt.\n- Policies must be specific (not generic statements).\n- Evidence must match the systems described in the self-assessment.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Screenshots cropped to hide system details or user roles.\n- Policies that mention 2FA but do not specify admin access or systems covered.\n- Evidence only for user (not admin) accounts.\n- Outdated evidence or evidence from test environments.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of which systems are considered “important” (Internet-facing, sensitive, business-critical).\n- Description of 2FA/MFA methods used for admin access.\n- Evidence that 2FA is enforced for all admin accounts on these systems.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We use Google Workspace admin console; all admin accounts require 2FA via Google Authenticator. See attached screenshot of admin login prompt.”\n- “Our cloud server admin panel (AWS/Azure) enforces MFA for all admin users. Attached: screenshot of MFA settings and login prompt.”\n- “We have a policy requiring 2FA for admin access to our CRM and finance systems. Attached: policy excerpt and screenshot of login page.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We use strong passwords for admin accounts, but no 2FA.”\n- “2FA is enabled for user accounts, not admins.”\n- “We plan to implement 2FA in the future.”\n- “Not feasible due to technical limitations” (without justification or compensating controls).\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Which systems are considered important and why?\n- Are all admin accounts covered by 2FA? If not, why?\n- What 2FA methods are used (app, SMS, hardware token)?\n- How is 2FA enforced (mandatory, optional, self-enrollment)?\n- Can you provide a screenshot of an admin login with 2FA prompt?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), it is acceptable if only a few admin accounts exist, but all must have 2FA.\n- If only one admin exists, 2FA must still be enabled for that account.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or built-in 2FA solutions (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) are acceptable.\n- SMS-based 2FA is acceptable if more secure options are not feasible.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For organizations in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare), higher assurance 2FA may be expected.\n- For organizations with no Internet-facing systems, auditor should confirm this claim and ensure internal critical systems are still considered.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- 2FA only enabled for some admin accounts.\n- 2FA enabled for users, not admins.\n- 2FA not enforced (optional enrollment).\n- No clear identification of important systems.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots not showing admin login.\n- Policies too generic or not enforced.\n- Evidence from non-production systems.\n\n### False Positives\n- Claims of 2FA with no supporting evidence.\n- Evidence of 2FA for unrelated systems.\n- 2FA enabled but not enforced for all admins.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are all admin accounts on important systems protected by 2FA?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is there credible, current evidence showing 2FA is enforced for admin access?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n3. **Is the evidence specific to admin accounts and important systems?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial (seek clarification).\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims 2FA is not feasible, escalate to senior auditor for risk-based review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and risk profile.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Ensure that evidence is directly relevant to the systems and accounts in scope.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, current evidence that 2FA is enforced for all admin accounts on important systems, especially those that are Internet-facing or contain sensitive/business-critical data. Acceptable methods include authenticator apps, OTP tokens, or SMS. Responses lacking evidence, specificity, or coverage should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not waive the requirement for admin 2FA.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations should, where feasible, use trusted software (e.g., password managers) to help employees manage their passphrases. This means providing employees with access to a reputable password management tool, or having a clear, organization-wide approach for secure passphrase storage and retrieval.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Reduce the risk of weak, reused, or forgotten passwords.\n- Prevent insecure storage of passwords (e.g., on paper, spreadsheets).\n- Enable employees to use strong, unique passphrases for different accounts.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nPassword-related breaches are among the most common cyber incidents. Small organizations often struggle with password complexity and management. This provision aims to ensure that, within reasonable means, organizations adopt tools or processes that help employees securely manage their credentials, thus reducing the likelihood of compromise due to poor password practices.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization uses a reputable, trusted password manager (cloud-based or on-premises) for employee passphrase management, **OR**\n- The organization has a documented, secure process for managing passphrases that does not rely on insecure methods (e.g., passwords are not stored in plain text, spreadsheets, or written down), **AND**\n- The solution is deployed to all relevant employees and is in active use.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No password management software or secure process is in place.\n- Employees are expected to remember all passwords or use insecure methods (e.g., writing passwords on paper, storing in unprotected files).\n- The organization claims password management is \"not feasible\" without reasonable justification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization is piloting a password manager but has not rolled it out to all staff.\n- Only some employees have access to a password manager.\n- The organization uses a password manager, but there is no evidence of actual use or employee awareness.\n- The organization claims infeasibility but provides some mitigating controls (e.g., enforced strong password policies, MFA) – requires further investigation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of password manager software in use (with sensitive info redacted).\n- License or subscription records for password manager tools.\n- Internal communications or training materials about password manager deployment.\n- Policy documents referencing password management practices.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Evidence should demonstrate organization-wide adoption, not just IT/admin use.\n- Documentation should be specific to the organization (not generic vendor brochures).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated or references tools no longer in use.\n- Only policy documents are provided, with no proof of implementation.\n- Evidence is limited to a single user or device.\n- Screenshots or documents appear generic or copied from the internet.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of the password manager or secure process in use.\n- Evidence that employees have access and are instructed to use the tool.\n- Confirmation that the tool is reputable (e.g., well-known vendors, not obscure freeware).\n- If not feasible, a reasonable explanation (e.g., all accounts are managed via SSO with enforced MFA, or organization size is 1-2 people).\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We use LastPass/1Password/Bitwarden for all staff. See attached screenshot of our admin dashboard and training email sent to employees.\"\n- \"All employees are required to use KeePass, and we provide installation instructions and support. See attached policy and screenshot.\"\n- \"Due to our small size (2 employees), all accounts are managed via Google Workspace SSO with enforced MFA. No additional password manager is needed.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"Employees are told to remember their passwords.\"\n- \"We keep passwords in a shared Excel file.\"\n- \"We do not use any password manager because it is too expensive,\" with no alternative controls.\n- \"We plan to implement a password manager in the future.\"\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- How do you ensure all employees are using the password manager?\n- What training or guidance is provided to staff?\n- If not feasible, what alternative controls are in place to ensure strong, unique passphrases?\n- Can you provide a recent example of how a new employee is onboarded with password management?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For micro-organizations (1-2 people), use of SSO with enforced MFA may be sufficient if all accounts are managed centrally.\n- For small organizations, free or open-source password managers are acceptable if deployed and used properly.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Auditors should accept low-cost or free solutions if they are reputable and properly implemented.\n- \"Not feasible\" is only acceptable with strong justification and compensating controls.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with regulatory requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter controls.\n- Organizations with highly mobile or remote staff should show how password management is handled offsite.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Password manager only used by IT/admin, not all staff.\n- Policy exists, but no evidence of actual use.\n- Employees use insecure methods (e.g., browser-saved passwords without master password).\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots or documents are outdated.\n- No evidence of employee awareness or training.\n\n### False Positives\n- Organization claims to use a password manager but provides no supporting evidence.\n- Use of browser-based password saving without additional controls is presented as compliant.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is a trusted password manager or secure process in place and in use by all relevant employees?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n   - **No:** Go to 2\n\n2. **Is there a reasonable justification for not using a password manager, with strong alternative controls?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS or escalate for review (if justification is borderline)\n   - **No:** FAIL\n\n3. **Is there evidence of partial implementation or pilot use?**\n   - **Yes:** Mark as Partial Compliance; request further evidence or clarification\n   - **No:** FAIL\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If justification for \"not feasible\" is unclear or weak, escalate to senior auditor.\n- If evidence is ambiguous or insufficient, request additional documentation.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and context.\n- Document rationale for decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, credible evidence that a trusted password manager or secure process is in place and used by all relevant employees, or that strong alternative controls are justified and documented. Responses lacking evidence, relying on insecure practices, or providing weak justifications should be marked as FAIL. Always consider organization size and resource constraints, but maintain the baseline security standard.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4a  \n**Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must enforce secure configuration settings on all key IT assets, including desktop computers, servers, and network devices (e.g., routers). This means default settings should be changed, unnecessary services disabled, and security features enabled according to recognized best practices (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, vendor guidelines). The approach can be manual or automated, and may use tools, scripts, or checklists.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Reduce attack surface by disabling unused features/services.\n- Prevent exploitation of default or weak configurations.\n- Ensure consistent baseline security across all devices.\n\n**Why This Is Important:**  \nDefault configurations are often insecure and widely known to attackers. Secure configuration is a foundational control that prevents many common attacks, especially for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Documented Approach:** Organization describes a clear, repeatable process for securing configurations (e.g., following CIS, vendor, or government guidelines).\n- **Scope:** Applies to all relevant assets (desktops, servers, routers, wireless access points).\n- **Implementation Evidence:** Evidence shows secure settings are enforced (e.g., screenshots, configuration files, tool output).\n- **Maintenance:** There is a process for reviewing and updating configurations (even if basic/manual).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of secure configuration practices.\n- Default settings are used without justification.\n- No mention of disabling unnecessary services or changing default credentials.\n- No process for reviewing or updating configurations.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some assets are secured, but others are not (e.g., desktops secured, but routers left default).\n- Process exists but is informal or inconsistently applied.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of assets.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedures/checklists for secure configuration.\n- Screenshots of configuration settings (e.g., disabled guest accounts, changed default passwords).\n- Output from security tools (e.g., baseline analyzers, configuration scripts).\n- Network diagrams showing device types and security controls.\n- Inventory lists indicating configuration status.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Should cover all relevant asset types.\n- Must be specific (generic statements or templates are insufficient).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated or not asset-specific.\n- Screenshots or documents are clearly copied from the internet or other organizations.\n- No evidence for critical assets (e.g., routers, servers).\n- Contradictions between responses and evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### **Who manages your computer network? Is there a network diagram?**\n- **What to Look For:** Named responsible person/team; up-to-date network diagram showing all key assets.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Our IT vendor manages the network; see attached diagram showing desktops, server, router, WiFi AP.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"Not sure,\" \"No diagram,\" or diagram missing key assets.\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"When was the diagram last updated? Who reviews it?\"\n\n### **Is there a secondary DNS server available?**\n- **What to Look For:** Awareness of redundancy and secure configuration.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Yes, we have a secondary DNS server configured as per vendor guidelines.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"No idea,\" \"We use default settings.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How is the DNS server secured? Are default credentials changed?\"\n\n### **Does the company maintain a local server (on-premises) or use the cloud? Are staff allowed external access (e.g., from home)?**\n- **What to Look For:** Description of server location and access controls.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"We use cloud servers with MFA; on-premises server has firewall and strong passwords.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"Anyone can access from anywhere,\" \"No controls.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How are remote access settings secured? Are VPNs used?\"\n\n### **If external access is allowed, is there a VPN for personal devices or other wireless access points?**\n- **What to Look For:** Use of secure remote access methods.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"VPN required for all remote access; default VPN settings changed.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"No VPN,\" \"Default VPN settings used.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How are VPN credentials managed? Are logs reviewed?\"\n\n### **Are your wireless networks visible from outside the office? Is the SSID hidden?**\n- **What to Look For:** Awareness and control of wireless network exposure.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"SSID is hidden; WPA2/WPA3 enabled; guest network separated.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"SSID is public; no password.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How often are wireless settings reviewed?\"\n\n### **If data is stored physically on-site, does the location have CCTV and security guards? Who has access?**\n- **What to Look For:** Physical security controls for IT assets.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Server room is locked; access logged; CCTV covers entry.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"Anyone can enter,\" \"No controls.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How is access to the server room managed?\"\n\n### **What other physical controls exist (e.g., visitor sign-in, employee access cards)?**\n- **What to Look For:** Additional physical security measures.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Visitor logbook; access cards for staff.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"No controls.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How are lost access cards handled?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple checklist or manual process is acceptable if consistently applied.\n- Network diagrams can be basic but must be accurate.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or built-in tools (e.g., Windows Security Baseline, router admin interface) are acceptable.\n- Formal documentation not required, but clear evidence of action is.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations in regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may need stricter controls.\n- Retail/hospitality may have more wireless assets—ensure these are covered.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only desktops secured; routers and WiFi left with default settings.\n- No process for reviewing configurations after initial setup.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not asset-specific.\n- Missing screenshots or configuration files.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating \"we follow best practices\" without evidence.\n- Providing a network diagram but no proof of secure settings.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence of secure configuration for all key asset types?**\n   - If YES → Go to 2.\n   - If NO → FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the evidence recent and specific to the organization?**\n   - If YES → Go to 3.\n   - If NO → Partial/FAIL.\n\n3. **Is there a process for maintaining/reviewing configurations?**\n   - If YES → PASS.\n   - If NO → Partial/FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or only partially covers assets, escalate to senior auditor or request more evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, organization-specific evidence that secure configuration practices are in place and maintained for all key IT assets. Responses must go beyond generic statements and demonstrate practical, proportionate implementation. Where evidence is lacking or only partially covers the scope, further clarification or escalation is required.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that all hardware and software are configured securely before being put into use. This includes:\n- Changing or disabling default passwords and accounts.\n- Avoiding or updating any weak/default settings (e.g., open ports, default admin usernames).\n- Using enhanced security features where available (e.g., deep scanning with anti-malware, not just standard/quick scans).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access due to predictable or well-known default settings.\n- Reduce the attack surface by eliminating weak configurations.\n- Ensure that security controls are operating at a level that provides meaningful protection.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nDefault configurations are widely known and exploited by attackers. Changing these settings is a fundamental step in preventing common attacks, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization **explicitly states** that default passwords and settings are changed or disabled on all new hardware/software before use.\n- There is a **documented process or checklist** for secure configuration (even if informal or simple).\n- The organization **performs deep/complete anti-malware scans** (not just quick scans) before deploying new systems.\n- Evidence (if provided) **demonstrates actual implementation** (e.g., screenshots, configuration logs, policy documents).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The organization **admits to using default passwords/settings** or cannot confirm they are changed.\n- No process or practice is described for secure configuration.\n- Only standard/quick anti-malware scans are performed, or no scans at all.\n- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or clearly fabricated.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization changes some, but not all, default settings (e.g., only on servers, not on workstations).\n- The process is ad hoc or inconsistently applied.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the environment.\n- In these cases, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedures, checklists, or policies (even if brief or informal).\n- Screenshots showing changed settings (e.g., password change screens, disabled default accounts).\n- Anti-malware scan logs or screenshots showing deep/complete scans.\n- Asset setup records or onboarding checklists.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last 12 months or since last major deployment).\n- Should **clearly show** that default/weak settings are addressed.\n- Screenshots/logs should be **specific** (not generic images from the internet).\n- If no formal documentation exists, a clear description of the process and a sample screenshot is acceptable for small organizations.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated, generic, or not tied to the organization’s actual systems.\n- Descriptions are vague (“We try to change passwords”) or non-committal.\n- No mention of anti-malware scanning or only quick scans are referenced.\n- Evidence is identical across multiple unrelated questions (copy-paste).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that default passwords/settings are changed or disabled.\n- Description or evidence of a process/checklist for secure configuration.\n- Confirmation that deep/complete anti-malware scans are performed before use.\n- Evidence that covers all relevant device types (servers, workstations, network devices, etc.).\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We change all default passwords on new devices before use. We use a setup checklist to ensure all default accounts are disabled, and we run a full anti-malware scan before connecting to the network. See attached screenshot of our checklist and scan log.”\n- “Our IT vendor configures all new laptops with unique passwords and disables default admin accounts. We require a deep scan with our anti-virus before deployment. Attached is a sample configuration report.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We use the default settings because they are secure enough.”\n- “We don’t know if the passwords are changed; our vendor handles it.”\n- “We only run a quick scan because it’s faster.”\n- No evidence or only generic statements without specifics.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide a sample screenshot or checklist showing the configuration steps?”\n- “How do you ensure that all devices (including printers, routers, etc.) have default settings changed?”\n- “When was the last time you reviewed or updated your configuration process?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal checklists or verbal confirmation with a screenshot may suffice.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized procedures and broader coverage.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept simple, practical processes (e.g., a one-page checklist) if consistently applied.\n- Do not require enterprise-grade configuration management tools.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements; however, baseline expectations remain the same for Cyber Essentials.\n- For organizations using managed service providers, ensure the provider’s process meets the same standards.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only changing passwords on some devices, not all.\n- Overlooking network devices (routers, switches) or IoT devices.\n- Assuming vendor defaults are secure without verification.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence or only providing policy documents without proof of implementation.\n- Outdated evidence (older than 12 months or before last major deployment).\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that claim compliance but provide no supporting evidence.\n- Evidence that is not specific to the organization’s environment.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Does the response clearly state that all default/weak settings are changed or disabled before use?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Go to 2\n\n2. **Is there evidence (or a credible description) of a process/checklist for secure configuration?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Go to 3\n\n3. **Is there confirmation that deep/complete anti-malware scans are performed before use?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Go to 4\n\n4. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and credible?**\n   - **No** → Partial Compliance (request more info)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional clarification/evidence.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical evidence that the organization avoids or updates weak/default configurations before use, including changing default passwords and performing deep anti-malware scans. Accept simple but consistent processes for small organizations, but require evidence of actual implementation.

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must identify and eliminate insecure configurations and weak protocols in their IT environment. This includes, but is not limited to, replacing outdated or insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP, WEP) with secure alternatives (e.g., HTTPS, WPA2/WPA3). The goal is to ensure that all hardware and software are configured to use secure, up-to-date settings and protocols.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent interception or tampering of data in transit.\n- Reduce exposure to common attacks exploiting weak protocols or insecure configurations.\n- Ensure baseline protection for network and system communications.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nMany cyberattacks exploit weak protocols (like HTTP or WEP) or default/insecure settings. Upgrading to secure protocols and configurations is a foundational step in reducing risk, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has identified and replaced all known insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP, WEP) with secure alternatives (e.g., HTTPS, WPA2/WPA3).\n- Evidence shows that insecure configurations have been remediated or are in the process of being remediated with a clear, short-term timeline.\n- The organization demonstrates awareness of what constitutes insecure protocols/configurations and has a process to address them.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Insecure protocols or configurations are still in use with no plan or timeline for remediation.\n- The organization is unaware of insecure protocols/configurations in their environment.\n- No evidence or only generic statements are provided, with no specifics on what has been replaced or upgraded.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some insecure protocols/configurations have been addressed, but others remain without a clear plan or timeline.\n- The organization is in the process of upgrading but lacks concrete evidence or timelines.\n- The response is vague or incomplete, requiring further clarification.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of configuration settings (e.g., Wi-Fi security settings showing WPA2/WPA3 enabled, web server settings showing HTTPS enabled).\n- Network diagrams or inventories indicating protocol usage.\n- Change logs or records of upgrades (e.g., migration from HTTP to HTTPS).\n- Policy documents or internal communications about protocol upgrades.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Screenshots or documents must clearly show the relevant settings/protocols.\n- Evidence should be specific to the organization’s environment (not generic templates).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not organization-specific.\n- Screenshots or documents are incomplete or do not clearly show secure settings.\n- No evidence provided, or evidence does not match the self-assessment response.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Specific mention of insecure protocols/configurations previously in use and what they were replaced with.\n- Clear evidence of secure protocols/configurations now in place.\n- A process or schedule for identifying and upgrading insecure settings.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We previously used HTTP for our internal web portal but have migrated to HTTPS as of March 2024. See attached screenshot of SSL certificate in use.”\n- “Our office Wi-Fi was upgraded from WEP to WPA2 in January 2024. Attached is a screenshot of the router settings.”\n- “We have reviewed all network devices and confirmed that only secure protocols (HTTPS, WPA2/WPA3) are enabled. See attached inventory and configuration screenshots.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We use secure settings” with no specifics or evidence.\n- “We plan to upgrade in the future” with no timeline or supporting documentation.\n- “Not applicable” without justification (e.g., organization does use Wi-Fi or web services but provides no evidence).\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide a screenshot or configuration file showing the current protocol in use?\n- When was the last review of your network and system configurations for insecure protocols?\n- Are there any systems still using insecure protocols? If so, what is the plan and timeline for upgrading them?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple screenshot of Wi-Fi/router settings and web server configuration may suffice.\n- For organizations with no in-house IT, evidence of engagement with an IT vendor or managed service provider to address insecure protocols is acceptable.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means at least reviewing all commonly used systems and upgrading the most critical insecure protocols.\n- If legacy systems cannot be upgraded, there must be documented compensating controls or a clear plan for replacement.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have additional regulatory requirements—ensure at least the Cyber Essentials baseline is met.\n- If the organization claims certain protocols are required for legacy compatibility, request justification and risk mitigation measures.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking guest Wi-Fi networks or internal web applications.\n- Assuming default device settings are secure without verification.\n- Failing to check all endpoints (e.g., printers, IoT devices).\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots that do not show relevant settings.\n- Evidence that is too old or not tied to the current environment.\n- Policies without proof of implementation.\n\n### False Positives\n- Statements of intent (“We will upgrade”) without action or evidence.\n- Evidence from test environments, not production systems.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Does the organization provide specific evidence of replacing/upgrading insecure protocols/configurations?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and clearly shows secure settings/protocols in use?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on severity).\n\n3. **Are there any remaining insecure protocols/configurations?**\n   - **No:** PASS.\n   - **Yes:** Is there a documented plan with a short-term timeline?\n     - **Yes:** Partial Compliance (follow up for completion).\n     - **No:** FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- If the organization claims exceptions due to legacy systems, escalate for senior auditor review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same evidence and response standards across all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and specific evidence that insecure protocols and configurations have been replaced or upgraded. Acceptable responses must go beyond generic statements and demonstrate actual implementation. Partial compliance may be accepted if there is a clear, imminent plan for full remediation. Consistency and proportionality should be maintained, considering the organization’s size and resources.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that any features, services, or applications on their hardware and software that are not actively needed for business operations are either disabled or completely removed. This includes, but is not limited to, unnecessary file sharing services, unused software macros, and open ports such as FTP that are not required.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Reduce the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary components that could be exploited.\n- Prevent unauthorized access or misuse of dormant services.\n- Ensure only essential and secure functionalities are available on organizational systems.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUnused features and services are common entry points for attackers. Disabling or removing them is a fundamental security practice that significantly lowers risk, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization demonstrates a clear process for identifying and disabling/removing unused features, services, or applications.\n- Evidence shows that unnecessary services (e.g., file sharing, macros, FTP ports) are disabled or removed on all relevant systems.\n- The response covers both initial system setup and ongoing maintenance (e.g., periodic reviews).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process or policy exists for disabling/removing unused features/services.\n- The organization cannot provide evidence or examples of disabled/removed features.\n- The response is generic, lacks specifics, or only states intent without action.\n- Unused features/services are knowingly left enabled without justification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization has started disabling/removing unused features but coverage is incomplete (e.g., only on some systems).\n- The process is informal or ad hoc, with limited documentation.\n- Some features/services are disabled, but others are overlooked or not addressed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of system/service configuration panels showing disabled features/services.\n- Lists or inventories of enabled/disabled services on representative devices.\n- Policy or procedural documents outlining the disabling/removal process.\n- Change logs or records of configuration changes.\n- Statements from IT personnel describing the process (for very small organizations).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Screenshots or lists should clearly identify the system and the disabled features/services.\n- Policies/procedures should be relevant and reflect actual practice.\n- Evidence should cover a representative sample of systems (not just one device).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to the organization.\n- Screenshots or lists are incomplete or do not show disabled features.\n- Policies exist but are not implemented in practice.\n- Evidence appears to be copied from online sources or templates without customization.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**\"Are unused features, services or applications disabled or removed?\"**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Specific mention of which features/services/applications are disabled or removed.\n- Description of how the organization identifies what is \"unused.\"\n- Evidence of actual implementation (not just policy).\n- Coverage across all relevant systems (workstations, servers, network devices).\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We review all new computers and disable file sharing, unused network ports, and macros in Office applications. See attached screenshots from three staff laptops and our server.\"\n- \"Our IT provider runs a monthly check to ensure only required services are enabled. Attached is a checklist and screenshots from our firewall and endpoint management tool.\"\n- \"We have a policy to remove all pre-installed software not needed for business. See the attached inventory and removal logs.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We try to keep things secure and only use what we need.\" (No specifics or evidence)\n- \"We have antivirus, so we are protected.\" (Irrelevant to this provision)\n- \"We don’t know what services are running, but we haven’t had any issues.\"\n- \"We plan to review this in the future.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide examples of features or services you have disabled or removed recently?\"\n- \"How do you determine which features/services are not needed?\"\n- \"Is this process applied to all devices, including servers and laptops?\"\n- \"How often do you review enabled features/services?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple checklist and a few screenshots may suffice.\n- For larger organizations, expect more formalized procedures and broader evidence coverage.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual reviews are acceptable if automated tools are not available.\n- Outsourced IT providers can perform this function, but the organization must be able to describe the process and provide evidence.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors may require specific features (e.g., FTP for legacy systems). In such cases, the organization must justify why a feature is enabled and demonstrate compensating controls.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only disabling/removing features on new devices, not existing ones.\n- Overlooking network devices (e.g., routers, firewalls).\n- Assuming default settings are secure without verification.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence for ongoing maintenance (only initial setup covered).\n- Screenshots or lists that do not clearly show disabled features/services.\n- Policies that are not implemented in practice.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that mention antivirus or unrelated controls as evidence.\n- Generic statements without supporting documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence that unused features/services/applications are identified and disabled/removed?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n2. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and covers a representative sample of systems?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request more evidence or clarification)\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n3. **Is the process ongoing (not just a one-time activity)?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification on ongoing process)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims exceptions (e.g., must keep FTP enabled), escalate for risk review and compensating controls assessment.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and specific evidence that unused features, services, or applications are disabled or removed across all relevant systems. Acceptable responses must go beyond intent and demonstrate actual implementation. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not compromise on the core requirement of reducing unnecessary attack surfaces. Escalate unclear or incomplete cases for further review.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that:\n- Devices do **not** automatically connect to open (unsecured) wireless networks.\n- The auto-run (or auto-play) feature for non-essential programs (e.g., USB drives, CDs, external applications) is **disabled** on all systems, except for essential security or backup software.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Prevent unauthorized access or malware infection via automatic connections to insecure networks.\n- Block malware or unwanted software from executing automatically when external media is connected.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nAuto-connecting to open networks and auto-running programs are common attack vectors for malware and unauthorized access. Disabling these features is a fundamental, low-cost way to reduce risk, especially for organizations with limited IT resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Automatic connection to open (unsecured) networks is disabled** on all organization devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices).\n- **Auto-run/auto-play for non-essential programs is disabled** on all endpoints, except for explicitly justified exceptions (e.g., backup or anti-malware solutions).\n- The organization can **demonstrate** these settings are in place (via screenshots, policy documents, or configuration reports).\n- Staff are **aware** of these restrictions (e.g., via policy, training, or communication).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Devices are allowed to auto-connect to open networks by default.\n- Auto-run/auto-play is enabled for non-essential programs or external media.\n- No evidence or only verbal assurance is provided.\n- Exceptions are made without clear justification or documentation.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some devices are compliant, but others are not (e.g., only office PCs, not laptops or mobiles).\n- Settings are applied, but not enforced or regularly checked.\n- Evidence is incomplete, outdated, or only covers a subset of devices.\n- Organization is in the process of implementing but not yet complete.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Screenshots** of device/network settings showing auto-connect and auto-run disabled.\n- **Configuration reports** from endpoint management tools or group policy settings.\n- **Written policies** or procedures referencing these controls.\n- **Staff communications** or training materials mentioning these requirements.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be **current** (within the last 6 months).\n- Should cover **all relevant device types** (PCs, laptops, mobiles).\n- Must be **specific** (e.g., actual screenshots, not generic images).\n- If using policies, must show **implementation**, not just intent.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not device-specific.\n- Only policy documents provided, with no proof of implementation.\n- Screenshots or reports are incomplete or edited.\n- No mention of mobile devices if they are in use.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that both auto-connect to open networks and auto-run for non-essential programs are disabled.\n- Evidence that settings are applied across all devices.\n- Justification for any exceptions (e.g., backup software).\n- Awareness or communication to staff.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We have disabled auto-connect to open networks on all laptops and mobile devices. Auto-run is disabled via group policy on all Windows PCs. See attached screenshots and policy excerpt.”\n- “All endpoints are managed via [tool], which enforces these settings. Attached is a configuration report and screenshot from a sample device.”\n- “Our IT policy (attached) requires these settings, and we have verified compliance as per the attached checklist.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We tell staff not to connect to open networks, but do not enforce it.”\n- “Auto-run is disabled on some PCs, but not all.”\n- “We don’t have evidence, but we believe it’s disabled.”\n- “We allow auto-run for convenience.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide screenshots or reports from a sample of devices?\n- How do you ensure new devices are configured with these settings?\n- Are mobile devices included in this control?\n- How often are these settings reviewed or checked?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), manual checks and screenshots from each device are acceptable.\n- For larger organizations, expect centralized enforcement (e.g., group policy, MDM).\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual configuration is acceptable if no management tools are available, provided evidence is shown.\n- Written procedures or checklists are acceptable if formal policies are not feasible.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with field staff or mobile devices must include these in scope.\n- Sectors with high use of removable media (e.g., design, engineering) must show controls are applied.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking mobile devices or BYOD.\n- Assuming default settings are secure.\n- Not disabling auto-run for all types of external media.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Only providing policy, not proof of implementation.\n- Screenshots from a single device only.\n- Outdated evidence.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that state intent but lack evidence.\n- Evidence from test or non-production devices.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must enable logging on their software and hardware assets wherever it is feasible. This includes, at a minimum, system logs, event logs, and security logs on devices such as servers, workstations, network equipment (e.g., firewalls, routers), and critical applications.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure that security-relevant events are recorded for later review and investigation.\n- Support detection of suspicious or unauthorized activities.\n- Provide evidence in the event of a security incident.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nLogging is a foundational security control that enables organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. Without logs, it is difficult to determine what happened during a security event or to demonstrate compliance. For resource-constrained organizations, enabling basic logging on key assets is a practical and effective step toward baseline security.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Logging is enabled on all feasible software and hardware assets, including (at minimum) servers, workstations, and network devices.\n- The organization can identify which assets have logging enabled and which do not, with justification for any exclusions (e.g., technical limitations).\n- The types of logs enabled (system, event, security) are specified.\n- Evidence (e.g., screenshots, configuration exports) demonstrates that logging is active.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Logging is not enabled on any or most assets, with no justification.\n- The organization is unaware of logging settings or cannot specify which assets have logging enabled.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.\n- Exclusions are made without reasonable justification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Logging is enabled on some, but not all, feasible assets.\n- The organization provides partial evidence or incomplete asset coverage.\n- Some justifications for exclusions are reasonable, but others are missing or unclear.\n- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of logging settings from representative devices (e.g., Windows Event Viewer, Linux syslog, firewall log configuration).\n- Configuration exports or reports showing logging is enabled.\n- Asset inventory indicating which devices have logging enabled.\n- Policy or procedure documents referencing logging requirements (optional but supportive).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 6 months).\n- Screenshots or exports must clearly show the asset name and logging status.\n- Evidence should cover a representative sample of asset types (not just one device).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not tied to the organization’s actual assets.\n- Screenshots are cropped to hide identifying information.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence is identical across unrelated assets (suggesting fabrication).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that logging is enabled on all (or all feasible) assets.\n- List or description of asset types covered (e.g., “All Windows PCs and our firewall have logging enabled”).\n- Justification for any assets where logging is not enabled (e.g., “Our printer does not support logging”).\n- Supporting evidence as described above.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Logging is enabled on all our servers, workstations, and firewall. See attached screenshots from Windows Event Viewer and our firewall’s log settings.”\n- “We have enabled system and security logs on all computers. Our network switch does not support logging, which we have confirmed with the vendor.”\n- “Attached is our asset inventory with a column indicating logging status, plus screenshots from representative devices.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We don’t know if logging is enabled.”\n- “We don’t have time to check logging settings.”\n- “Logging is only enabled on one device, but we have 10 computers.”\n- No evidence provided, or evidence is not related to logging.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide screenshots or configuration exports from additional devices?”\n- “Why is logging not enabled on these specific assets?”\n- “When was logging last reviewed or verified?”\n- “How do you ensure logging remains enabled after updates or changes?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), evidence from each device may be practical and expected.\n- For larger organizations, a representative sample (e.g., 2-3 devices per asset type) is acceptable.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- If certain devices cannot support logging due to technical limitations, a reasonable explanation is acceptable.\n- Manual processes for checking logging are acceptable if automated tools are not available.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have additional regulatory requirements for logging; however, for Cyber Essentials, only baseline logging is required.\n- For organizations using cloud services, ensure logging is enabled in cloud management consoles where feasible.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Logging only enabled on servers, ignoring workstations or network devices.\n- No justification for assets without logging.\n- Outdated or irrelevant evidence.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots without timestamps or asset identifiers.\n- Evidence from test or non-production systems.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy documents stating logging is required, but no evidence of actual implementation.\n- Evidence from a single device presented as representative of all assets.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is logging enabled on all feasible assets?**\n   - **Yes:** Go to 2.\n   - **No:** Go to 3.\n\n2. **Is sufficient, recent, and credible evidence provided for a representative sample of assets?**\n   - **Yes:** **PASS**\n   - **No:** **Partial Compliance** (request more evidence)\n\n3. **Are exclusions justified and reasonable?**\n   - **Yes:** Go to 2.\n   - **No:** **FAIL**\n\n4. **Is there a clear lack of awareness or evidence regarding logging?**\n   - **Yes:** **FAIL**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If the organization claims technical limitations, request vendor documentation or further explanation.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same evidence and justification standards across all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that logging is enabled on all feasible assets, with reasonable justifications for any exclusions. Responses must be practical and proportionate to the organization’s size and resources, but must demonstrate actual implementation, not just intent or policy. Incomplete, outdated, or generic evidence should result in follow-up or a FAIL decision.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.6.4g  \n**Secure/Protect: Secure configuration – Use secure settings for the organisation’s hardware and software**  \n**Provision Requirement:** Automatic lock/session log out should be enabled after 15 minutes of inactivity for user sessions on laptops, servers, non-mobile devices, databases, and administrator portals.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must configure all relevant IT assets (laptops, desktops, servers, databases, admin portals) to automatically lock or log out user sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity. This setting should be applied consistently across all applicable devices and systems.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorized access to unattended devices or sessions.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches from unattended, unlocked systems.\n- Enforce a baseline of secure configuration across the organization.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUnattended, unlocked sessions are a common vector for internal and external threats. Enabling automatic session lock/log out is a simple, effective control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization confirms that automatic lock/session log out is enabled after 15 minutes (or less) of inactivity on **all** relevant assets: laptops, desktops, servers, databases, and admin portals.\n- Evidence (e.g., screenshots, configuration policies) is provided for at least a representative sample of each asset type.\n- The setting is enforced centrally (e.g., via group policy) or documented as part of standard operating procedures for all users.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- The organization does **not** have automatic lock/session log out enabled, or the inactivity period exceeds 15 minutes.\n- The setting is only applied to some assets, with no plan or justification for exceptions.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated, outdated, or irrelevant.\n- The organization is unaware of the requirement or claims it is \"not applicable\" without valid justification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The setting is enabled on most, but not all, relevant assets (e.g., only on laptops, not on servers or admin portals).\n- The inactivity timeout is set slightly above 15 minutes (e.g., 20 minutes) with a reasonable explanation and a plan to remediate.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some asset types.\n- The organization is in the process of rolling out the setting and provides a clear, time-bound plan for full compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of system settings showing session timeout/lockout configuration (for each asset type).\n- Group policy or configuration management documentation.\n- Written IT policy or SOP referencing the 15-minute inactivity lockout.\n- Sample user communication or training materials referencing this control.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (dated within the last 12 months).\n- Screenshots should clearly show the relevant setting and device/system name.\n- Policies should be organization-specific, not generic templates.\n- Evidence should cover all relevant asset types or provide a valid justification for any exclusions.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Screenshots or documents with missing or obscured details.\n- Evidence referencing only one device or user.\n- Policies that are generic, undated, or not implemented in practice.\n- Claims of compliance without any supporting evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Explicit confirmation that the 15-minute (or less) inactivity lock/session log out is enabled.\n- Mention of all relevant asset types (laptops, desktops, servers, databases, admin portals).\n- Evidence that the setting is enforced, not just recommended.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"Yes, all laptops, desktops, and servers are configured to lock after 15 minutes of inactivity via group policy. See attached screenshots and policy document.\"\n- \"Session timeout is set to 15 minutes for our admin portal and database. Attached are screenshots from the admin console.\"\n- \"We use a standard operating procedure requiring all users to enable this setting. Attached is the SOP and sample screenshots from user devices.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"No, we do not have this setting enabled.\"\n- \"Only some users have this setting; we are not sure about the rest.\"\n- \"We rely on users to lock their screens manually.\"\n- \"We do not have evidence but believe it is enabled.\"\n- \"Not applicable\" without a valid, documented justification.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide screenshots or documentation for all relevant asset types?\"\n- \"How is this setting enforced across the organization (e.g., group policy, manual configuration)?\"\n- \"Are there any exceptions? If so, please explain and justify.\"\n- \"When was this setting last reviewed or updated?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), evidence from each device may not be practical; a sample plus a written policy/SOP is acceptable.\n- For organizations with only a few devices, manual configuration is acceptable if documented and consistently applied.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Centralized enforcement (e.g., group policy) is ideal but not mandatory for small organizations; manual settings are acceptable if consistently applied and evidenced.\n- Free or built-in OS features (e.g., Windows/Mac auto-lock) are sufficient.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For organizations with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance), stricter enforcement may be expected.\n- For organizations with no servers or admin portals, a clear statement and evidence of asset inventory is required.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only laptops/desktops are configured; servers, databases, or admin portals are overlooked.\n- Timeout is set longer than 15 minutes.\n- Reliance on user behavior rather than enforced settings.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Outdated screenshots or policies.\n- Evidence only covers a single device or user.\n- Lack of documentation for manual processes.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy exists but is not implemented in practice.\n- Evidence is generic or from internet sources, not organization-specific.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is the 15-minute (or less) inactivity lock/session log out enabled on all relevant assets?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to evidence check.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is there credible, current evidence for each asset type?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial or FAIL (depending on scope and explanation).\n\n3. **Are there any exceptions?**\n   - **No:** PASS.\n   - **Yes:** Are they justified and documented?\n     - **Yes:** Partial (with plan to remediate).\n     - **No:** FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is incomplete or ambiguous, request additional documentation.\n- If the organization claims exceptions, escalate to senior auditor for review.\n- If there are signs of fabricated or misleading evidence, escalate immediately.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations of similar size and complexity.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Ensure that evidence is organization-specific and covers all relevant asset types.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, organization-specific evidence that all relevant devices and systems are configured to automatically lock or log out after 15 minutes of inactivity. Responses should be supported by current, credible documentation or screenshots. Partial compliance may be accepted with a clear, time-bound remediation plan. Consistency and practicality should guide the assessment, with reasonable accommodations for small organizations, but without compromising the security objective.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**\n- If the organization uses **mobile devices**, **IoT devices**, and/or **cloud environments** within the certification scope, it must implement specific secure configuration controls:\n  - **Mobile Devices:**  \n    - Devices must not be jail-broken or rooted.\n    - Device passcodes must be enabled.\n    - Automatic device lock must activate after 2 minutes of inactivity.\n    - Apps must only be installed from official/trusted sources.\n  - **IoT Devices:**  \n    - IoT devices must be on a network separated from core assets/data.\n    - Security features (e.g., disabling auto-discovery, UPnP) must be enabled.\n    - Where possible, devices should have a Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) rating.\n  - **Cloud Environments:**  \n    - Security logging and monitoring must be enabled (e.g., API call history, change tracking).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Prevent unauthorized access and reduce attack surface.\n- Limit the impact of compromised devices or accounts.\n- Ensure visibility and traceability of actions in cloud environments.\n- Mitigate risks from insecure or poorly configured devices.\n\n**Context/Importance:**\n- Mobile, IoT, and cloud assets are common attack vectors.\n- Baseline controls are essential to prevent common threats (malware, unauthorized access, lateral movement).\n- These measures are practical and achievable for most organizations, even with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Mobile Devices:**  \n  - Clear evidence that jail-breaking/rooting is prohibited and monitored.\n  - Passcodes are enforced on all devices.\n  - Auto-lock is set to 2 minutes or less.\n  - Policy/process ensures apps are only from official/trusted sources.\n- **IoT Devices:**  \n  - IoT devices are on a segregated network (e.g., VLAN, separate Wi-Fi).\n  - Security features (e.g., UPnP, auto-discovery) are disabled or restricted.\n  - CLS-rated devices are used where available, or rationale provided if not.\n- **Cloud:**  \n  - Security logging and monitoring are enabled (e.g., audit logs, API tracking).\n  - Evidence of regular review or alerting.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence or policy for any of the required controls.\n- Devices are jail-broken/rooted, or no controls to prevent this.\n- Passcodes/auto-lock not enforced or set to insecure values.\n- Apps can be installed from any source.\n- IoT devices are on the same network as sensitive assets/data.\n- Security features on IoT devices are not enabled or are explicitly disabled.\n- No evidence of cloud logging/monitoring.\n- Responses are vague, generic, or lack supporting evidence.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some controls are in place, but not all required (e.g., passcodes enabled but no auto-lock).\n- Controls are described but not enforced (e.g., “we ask staff not to root devices” but no technical enforcement).\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the asset base.\n- For IoT/Cloud, some but not all features are enabled, or only some devices/environments are covered.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Mobile:**  \n  - Mobile device management (MDM) policy/screenshots.\n  - Device configuration screenshots (passcode, auto-lock).\n  - Policy documents or staff communications.\n- **IoT:**  \n  - Network diagrams showing segregation.\n  - Device configuration screenshots (UPnP, auto-discovery settings).\n  - Procurement records for CLS-rated devices.\n- **Cloud:**  \n  - Screenshots of enabled logging/monitoring.\n  - Audit log samples.\n  - Cloud provider configuration pages.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 6–12 months).\n- Screenshots should clearly show relevant settings.\n- Policies should be organization-specific, not generic templates.\n- Evidence should match the assets in scope.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Outdated screenshots or policies.\n- Evidence from test/demo environments, not production.\n- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.\n- Evidence that does not match described assets (e.g., screenshots from different device models).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Explicit mention of each required control for each asset type in scope.\n- Concrete examples or screenshots of settings.\n- Policies or technical controls that enforce requirements.\n- Evidence that covers all relevant devices/environments.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “All company-issued mobile devices are managed via MDM. Jail-breaking is blocked, passcodes are enforced, and auto-lock is set to 2 minutes. See attached screenshots and MDM policy.”\n- “IoT devices are on a separate Wi-Fi network with no access to internal data. UPnP is disabled on all devices. See network diagram and device settings screenshots.”\n- “Cloud logging is enabled for all accounts. Attached are screenshots of the audit log settings and a sample log export.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We tell staff not to root their phones” (no enforcement or evidence).\n- “IoT devices are on the same network as everything else.”\n- “We trust staff to only install apps from the App Store” (no policy or enforcement).\n- “Cloud logging is available but not enabled.”\n- “No evidence provided.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide screenshots or policy documents showing these settings are enforced?\n- How do you ensure staff do not install unauthorized apps?\n- How often are cloud logs reviewed, and by whom?\n- Are all IoT devices covered by the network segregation?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, manual processes (e.g., regular device checks, simple written policies) may be acceptable if consistently applied.\n- Technical enforcement (e.g., MDM) is preferred but not mandatory if resource constraints exist and compensating controls are in place.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means controls are implemented to the extent feasible (e.g., using built-in device settings, free MDM tools, basic network segregation).\n- Documentation can be simple but must be clear and specific.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have additional regulatory requirements—note but do not penalize if baseline Cyber Essentials controls are met.\n- For organizations with only a few devices, manual checks may suffice.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking personal devices used for work (BYOD).\n- Not enforcing auto-lock or passcodes.\n- IoT devices left on default settings or not segregated.\n- Cloud logging enabled but never reviewed.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Policies are generic or not tailored to the organization.\n- Screenshots are outdated or incomplete.\n- No evidence for some asset types in scope.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating controls exist without evidence.\n- Policies that are not enforced in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are mobile, IoT, or cloud assets in scope?**\n   - If NO: Mark as N/A for this provision.\n   - If YES: Continue.\n\n2. **Are all required controls for each asset type described and evidenced?**\n   - If YES: PASS.\n   - If NO: Continue.\n\n3. **Are some controls missing, not enforced, or not evidenced?**\n   - If YES: Mark as Partial Compliance; request clarification or additional evidence.\n   - If after follow-up, gaps remain: FAIL.\n\n4. **Is evidence credible, recent, and organization-specific?**\n   - If YES: PASS.\n   - If NO: FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete after follow-up, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If organization claims technical limitations, assess if compensating controls are reasonable.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations with similar asset types and risk profiles.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, specific, and recent evidence that all required secure configuration controls are in place for mobile, IoT, and cloud assets in scope. Responses must go beyond policy statements and demonstrate actual implementation. Where resource constraints exist, practical and proportionate controls are acceptable if they achieve the security objectives. Incomplete, generic, or unsupported responses should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance, with follow-up as needed.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that critical or important updates—especially security patches—for operating systems and applications are identified and applied as soon as possible. This means there should be a clear, prompt process for patching vulnerabilities, particularly those rated as critical or high-risk.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Minimize the window of exposure to known vulnerabilities.\n- Prevent exploitation of unpatched systems by attackers.\n- Maintain a secure baseline for all devices and systems.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUnpatched software is a leading cause of cyber incidents. Attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities for which patches already exist. Prompt patching is a fundamental, high-impact control that significantly reduces risk, especially for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has a defined process for identifying and applying critical/important updates.\n- Critical security patches are applied **within a reasonable timeframe** (e.g., within 14 days of release, or sooner if feasible).\n- The process covers both operating systems and key applications.\n- Evidence shows recent and regular patching activity.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process or ad-hoc/unstructured approach to patching.\n- Critical updates are delayed significantly (e.g., applied more than a month after release) or not applied at all.\n- Only some systems are patched, or only non-critical updates are applied.\n- No evidence of recent patching.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Patching is performed, but not consistently within a reasonable timeframe.\n- Some systems or applications are regularly patched, but others are neglected.\n- The process exists but is not documented or is inconsistently followed.\n- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Patch management policy or documented process (even if informal).\n- Patch logs, update histories, or screenshots showing recent updates.\n- System-generated reports from update management tools (if available).\n- Manual records or checklists for very small organizations.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be **recent** (within the last 3 months).\n- Should cover both operating systems and key applications.\n- Must demonstrate that critical/important updates are prioritized.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated (older than 3 months).\n- Only generic statements, no supporting documentation or screenshots.\n- Evidence only covers non-critical updates or a subset of systems.\n- Fabricated or inconsistent records (e.g., identical screenshots for different systems).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question: \"What is the frequency of patching for software and operating‐system vulnerabilities?\"\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Specific frequency (e.g., \"weekly,\" \"within 14 days of patch release,\" \"immediately for critical patches\").\n- Mention of how critical/important patches are prioritized.\n- Description of the process (manual or automated).\n- Evidence that matches the described process.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We review and apply critical security patches within 7 days of release. Other updates are applied monthly. Evidence: Patch logs from the last 2 months attached.\"\n- \"Automatic updates are enabled for all systems. Screenshots of update settings and recent update history provided.\"\n- \"We check for updates every week and apply critical patches immediately. Manual checklist attached.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We patch when we have time.\"\n- \"Updates are applied occasionally.\"\n- \"No formal process, but we try to keep systems updated.\"\n- No evidence provided, or evidence is outdated.\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"How do you determine which patches are critical or important?\"\n- \"Can you provide recent examples of critical patches applied?\"\n- \"Are all devices and key applications included in your patching process?\"\n- \"How do you ensure remote or offsite devices are updated?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple manual process (e.g., a checklist or calendar reminders) is acceptable if it is followed consistently.\n- Automated updates (e.g., Windows Update, auto-update for browsers) are acceptable if enabled and monitored.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- \"Reasonable effort\" means updates are applied promptly, but minor delays (e.g., a few days) are acceptable if justified (e.g., operational constraints).\n- Organizations are not expected to have enterprise-grade patch management tools, but must demonstrate awareness and action.\n\n### Industry Context\n- If the organization uses specialized or legacy systems, reasonable compensating controls (e.g., network isolation, vendor support) should be described if updates cannot be applied immediately.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only patching operating systems, neglecting applications (e.g., browsers, office suites).\n- Relying solely on user-initiated updates without oversight.\n- Assuming auto-update is sufficient without verification.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Evidence is generic, not organization-specific.\n- No proof of recent patching activity.\n- Policy exists but is not implemented in practice.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that mention a process but provide no evidence.\n- Screenshots or logs that are not recent or do not show critical updates.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a defined process for identifying and applying critical/important updates?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Are critical updates applied within a reasonable timeframe (≤14 days)?**\n   - **No** → FAIL or Partial Compliance (if some effort is shown)\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is there recent, credible evidence of patching activity?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n4. **Does the process cover both operating systems and key applications?**\n   - **No** → Partial Compliance or FAIL\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or only partially meets requirements, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is doubt about the authenticity of evidence or if compensating controls are claimed for unpatchable systems.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for timeliness and evidence quality across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a clear, prompt, and consistent process for applying critical software updates, supported by recent and credible evidence. The process should be practical for the organization's size and resources, but must not neglect key systems or delay critical patches. Incomplete, outdated, or unsupported responses should result in a FAIL or require further investigation.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must perform compatibility testing on updates (for both operating systems and applications) before deploying them to production devices and systems. This means that, prior to installation, updates are checked to ensure they do not disrupt critical business functions or cause software/hardware conflicts.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent business disruption due to faulty or incompatible updates.\n- Ensure updates do not introduce new vulnerabilities or operational issues.\n- Maintain system stability and availability after updates.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nUnvetted updates can cause system outages, application failures, or data loss. Even small organizations can be severely impacted if an update breaks a critical function. Compatibility testing, even if basic, helps ensure updates are safe to deploy and supports business continuity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization demonstrates a defined process for compatibility testing of updates before installation.\n- Evidence shows that updates are tested on at least one non-production device or environment before being rolled out organization-wide.\n- The process covers both operating system and application updates.\n- The approach is proportionate to the organization’s size and resources (e.g., manual testing on a spare device for small organizations).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No compatibility testing is performed before updates are installed.\n- The organization relies solely on automatic updates without any form of pre-deployment testing.\n- The process is described only in theory, with no supporting evidence or examples.\n- Testing is limited to only some updates (e.g., only OS, not applications) without justification.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Testing is performed inconsistently or only for major updates.\n- The process is informal or ad-hoc, with limited documentation or evidence.\n- The organization tests only on a subset of devices or applications, with some rationale (e.g., resource constraints), but lacks a plan to address gaps.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Written procedures or policies describing compatibility testing steps.\n- Screenshots, logs, or records showing test updates applied to non-production devices.\n- Change management records or update logs indicating testing activities.\n- Examples of past updates where compatibility testing was performed.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Documentation should be clear, specific, and relevant to the organization’s environment.\n- Screenshots or logs should show dates, device names, and update details.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague statements such as “we test updates” without specifics.\n- Outdated or generic documentation not tailored to the organization.\n- Evidence that only covers one type of update (e.g., OS but not applications).\n- No evidence of actual testing (only policy documents).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Description of how updates are tested for compatibility before installation.\n- Identification of who is responsible for testing.\n- Evidence of testing on non-production or spare devices.\n- Coverage of both operating system and application updates.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We have a spare laptop where all Windows and Office updates are installed and tested for a week before rolling out to staff devices.

Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, testing on a single spare device or during off-hours on a primary device is acceptable.\n- Formal test environments are not required; practical, low-cost approaches are sufficient.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Manual testing is acceptable if automated tools or dedicated test environments are not feasible.\n- Reasonable effort means at least basic testing is performed before updates are widely deployed.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations with specialized or legacy applications should demonstrate extra care in testing.\n- Sectors with regulatory or operational dependencies (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require more thorough testing.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming vendor or automatic updates are always safe without testing.\n- Only testing operating system updates, neglecting applications.\n- No documentation or records of testing activities.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence showing actual testing (e.g., only policies, no logs).\n- Evidence is outdated or not relevant to current systems.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that describe a process but provide no proof it is followed.\n- Evidence that is generic or copied from templates.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a process for compatibility testing before installing updates?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n2. **Is there evidence that this process is followed (e.g., logs, screenshots, records)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n3. **Does the process cover both operating system and application updates?**\n   - If NO, but justified and risk is low → Partial Compliance (seek clarification)\n   - If NO, and unjustified → FAIL\n   - If YES → PASS\n\n4. **Is the approach proportionate to the organization’s size and resources?**\n   - If YES → PASS\n   - If NO → Partial Compliance or FAIL\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or only partially meets requirements, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims exceptions due to business needs, seek justification and supporting documentation.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Ensure evidence is recent and directly relevant to the provision.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical evidence that the organization tests updates for compatibility before installation, covering both OS and applications, with an approach scaled to their size and resources. Lack of evidence, reliance on automatic updates without testing, or incomplete coverage should result in a FAIL or require further investigation.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.7.4c  \n**Update: Software updates – Update software on devices and systems**  \n**Provision Requirement:** The organisation should consider enabling automatic updates for critical operating system and application patches where feasible so that they can receive the latest updates.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must enable automatic updates for critical operating system and application patches wherever it is technically and operationally feasible. This ensures that devices and systems receive the latest security updates promptly, reducing the window of vulnerability to known threats.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities by ensuring timely patching.\n- Reduce reliance on manual update processes, which are prone to human error or neglect.\n- Ensure critical systems are protected against common exploits targeting outdated software.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nAutomatic updates are a foundational defense against cyberattacks exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities. For resource-constrained organizations, automating this process is a practical way to maintain a secure baseline without requiring constant manual intervention.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Automatic updates are enabled for all critical operating systems and major applications where the feature is available and does not disrupt business operations.\n- The organization demonstrates awareness of which systems/applications support automatic updates and has enabled the feature wherever feasible.\n- If automatic updates are not enabled for certain systems, the organization provides a reasonable, documented justification (e.g., legacy system incompatibility, critical business application conflicts) and describes alternative update processes.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Automatic updates are not enabled for critical systems/applications where it is feasible to do so, with no valid justification.\n- The organization is unaware of the update settings or has not reviewed/update policies.\n- No evidence is provided, or evidence contradicts the self-assessment response.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Automatic updates are enabled on some, but not all, critical systems/applications, with incomplete or unclear justification for exceptions.\n- The organization is in the process of enabling automatic updates but has not completed implementation.\n- The organization relies solely on manual updates without strong justification or compensating controls.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of update settings showing automatic updates enabled on representative devices/systems.\n- Policy documents or procedures referencing automatic update requirements.\n- Inventory lists indicating which systems have automatic updates enabled.\n- Exception logs or memos explaining why automatic updates are not enabled on specific systems.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).\n- Screenshots should clearly show device/system names and update settings.\n- Documentation should be specific to the organization and not generic templates.\n- Justifications for exceptions must be credible and relevant.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to the organization’s environment.\n- Screenshots are cropped or edited to obscure key details.\n- No evidence provided for claimed exceptions.\n- Policies exist but are not implemented in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Confirmation that automatic updates are enabled for all critical operating systems and applications where possible.\n- Clear identification of any exceptions, with valid business or technical reasons.\n- Evidence that settings have been reviewed and applied across the organization.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Automatic updates are enabled on all Windows and Mac computers, as well as Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader. For our legacy accounting software, automatic updates are not available; we apply updates manually monthly and have documented this process.”\n- Screenshot of Windows Update settings showing “Automatic Updates: On” for multiple devices.\n- Policy excerpt: “All staff laptops must have automatic updates enabled for OS and core applications.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We update our systems when we remember.”\n- “Automatic updates are not enabled because it’s too disruptive,” with no further explanation or compensating controls.\n- No evidence provided, or evidence only covers a single device when multiple are in use.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Which systems/applications do not support automatic updates, and how are they updated?\n- How often are manual updates performed for exceptions?\n- Can you provide screenshots or logs from a sample of devices?\n- How do you ensure new devices are configured with automatic updates enabled?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 devices), spot-checking a sample of devices may suffice.\n- For micro-businesses, a simple written policy and a few screenshots may be adequate.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- If certain legacy systems cannot support automatic updates, a documented manual update process is acceptable if performed regularly (e.g., monthly).\n- Reasonable effort means enabling automatic updates where the feature is available and does not cause operational issues.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with specialized software (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing) may have legitimate exceptions; ensure these are documented and alternative update processes are in place.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming updates are enabled by default without verification.\n- Overlooking third-party applications that support automatic updates.\n- Failing to document exceptions or manual update processes.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Providing only policy documents without evidence of implementation.\n- Screenshots from a single device when multiple device types are in use.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that claim “all systems are updated automatically” without supporting evidence.\n- Policies that require automatic updates but are not enforced in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are automatic updates enabled for all critical OS/applications where feasible?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to evidence check.\n   - **No:** Is there a valid, documented justification and compensating controls?\n     - **Yes:** Partial compliance; assess adequacy of compensating controls.\n     - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is sufficient, credible evidence provided?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** FAIL or request additional evidence.\n\n3. **Are exceptions reasonable and documented?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS or Partial (if compensating controls are adequate).\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If exceptions are numerous or poorly justified, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If evidence is ambiguous or potentially fabricated, request additional evidence or clarification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and justification across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that automatic updates are enabled for all critical systems where possible, with documented exceptions and compensating controls for any gaps. Responses must be specific, supported by credible evidence, and proportionate to the organization’s size and resources. Inconsistent, vague, or unsupported claims should result in a FAIL or request for further clarification.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**\n- **Mobile Devices:** Updates and patches must only be downloaded from trusted sources (e.g., official app stores, manufacturer’s update channels).\n- **IoT Devices:** Any IoT device (e.g., CCTV, printers) that is no longer receiving software patches or updates must be removed or replaced.\n- **Cloud Environments:**  \n  - The organization must understand the cloud shared responsibility model (i.e., which party—organization or CSP—is responsible for updates/patches).\n  - The organization must have visibility into updates/patches performed by the CSP.\n  - The organization must define security requirements for software updates in its agreements with CSPs.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Prevent introduction of malware or vulnerabilities via untrusted update sources.\n- Ensure all devices remain protected against known vulnerabilities.\n- Clarify and enforce update responsibilities in cloud environments to avoid unpatched exposures.\n\n**Why This Is Important:**\n- Unpatched devices are a leading cause of compromise.\n- IoT and mobile devices are often overlooked in patch management.\n- Cloud environments introduce shared responsibility, which, if misunderstood, can leave critical gaps.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- **Mobile:** Organization confirms updates/patches are only from official/manufacturer sources, with supporting evidence (e.g., policy, screenshots, device settings).\n- **IoT:** Organization identifies IoT devices in use and demonstrates a process for removing/replacing devices that no longer receive updates.\n- **Cloud:** Organization can explain the shared responsibility model for each cloud service, shows evidence of monitoring CSP updates, and has documented security requirements for updates in CSP agreements or policies.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Updates for mobile devices are sourced from unofficial or unverified channels.\n- IoT devices that are unsupported or unpatched remain in use with no plan for replacement.\n- Organization is unaware of or cannot explain the cloud shared responsibility model.\n- No evidence of monitoring CSP updates or defining update requirements for CSPs.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Organization has some, but not all, mobile/IoT/cloud assets covered.\n- Processes are informal or ad hoc, with limited documentation.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers part of the requirement.\n- Further clarification or evidence is needed to confirm compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- **Mobile:** Device management policy, screenshots of update settings, MDM configuration, staff communications.\n- **IoT:** Asset inventory, records of device replacement, vendor support documentation, removal logs.\n- **Cloud:** CSP agreements, shared responsibility documentation, update/patch notifications from CSP, internal policy referencing cloud update responsibilities.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Documentation should be specific to the organization’s environment.\n- Screenshots or logs should clearly show relevant settings or actions.\n- Policies should be formally approved or communicated.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Generic or templated policies with no organization-specific details.\n- Outdated evidence (older than 12 months).\n- Lack of asset inventory or incomplete device lists.\n- No documentation of cloud responsibilities or CSP communications.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of mobile, IoT, and cloud assets in scope.\n- Explicit statements about update sources for mobile devices.\n- Evidence of IoT device lifecycle management (removal/replacement).\n- Understanding and documentation of cloud shared responsibility.\n- Evidence of CSP update monitoring and requirements.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “All mobile devices are configured to only accept updates from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. See attached MDM policy and screenshots.”\n- “We maintain an IoT inventory. Devices no longer supported by the vendor are decommissioned—see attached removal log.”\n- “Our cloud provider is AWS. We have reviewed the AWS shared responsibility model (see attached document), and our contract specifies patching requirements. We receive monthly update reports from AWS.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We update devices when we remember.”\n- “We use whatever update source is available.”\n- “We have IoT devices but don’t know if they’re still supported.”\n- “We use cloud services but are not sure who is responsible for updates.”\n- No supporting evidence provided.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide a list of all mobile/IoT/cloud assets in use?\n- How do you verify that IoT devices are still receiving updates?\n- Can you show a recent example of a CSP update notification or report?\n- Where is the shared responsibility model documented for your cloud services?\n- How do you ensure staff only use official app stores for updates?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple documented process and basic evidence (e.g., screenshots, email communications) are acceptable.\n- Asset inventories can be spreadsheets or simple lists.\n- Formal contracts with CSPs may be replaced by documented acceptance of standard CSP terms if custom contracts are not feasible.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means using built-in device settings, vendor notifications, and basic asset tracking.\n- Manual processes are acceptable if consistently applied and documented.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with high IoT usage (e.g., retail, healthcare) may need more robust IoT management.\n- Organizations using only SaaS cloud services may have limited update responsibilities but must still understand the shared responsibility model.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Overlooking IoT devices (e.g., printers, cameras).\n- Assuming CSP handles all updates without verification.\n- Using unofficial app stores or sideloading apps on mobile devices.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- No asset inventory or incomplete lists.\n- Policies not tailored to actual practices.\n- Evidence not dated or not organization-specific.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating “we always update” without specifying sources or providing evidence.\n- Listing cloud providers but not addressing shared responsibility or update monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are mobile devices only updated via trusted sources?**\n   - Yes, with evidence → PASS\n   - No, or unclear → FAIL\n\n2. **Are unsupported/unpatched IoT devices removed or replaced?**\n   - Yes, with evidence → PASS\n   - No, or unclear → FAIL\n\n3. **Is the cloud shared responsibility model understood and documented?**\n   - Yes, with evidence of monitoring and requirements → PASS\n   - No, or unclear → FAIL\n\n4. **Is evidence current, specific, and credible?**\n   - Yes → PASS\n   - No → FAIL\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request clarification or additional documentation.\n- If the organization claims not to use mobile, IoT, or cloud assets, verify this claim with asset inventories.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is a dispute over what constitutes “trusted sources” or “visibility” in cloud environments.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Use follow-up questions to clarify before making a final decision.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, current, and organization-specific evidence that mobile updates are from trusted sources, unsupported IoT devices are removed, and cloud update responsibilities are understood and managed. Responses must be practical but credible, with documentation or screenshots where possible. Incomplete, generic, or unsupported claims should result in a FAIL or request for further evidence.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4a  \n**Clause: Backup – Back up essential data and store them offline**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must:\n- Identify its business-critical systems and essential business information (i.e., what is vital for business recovery after a cyber incident).\n- Perform regular backups of this data.\n- Store backups offline (i.e., not continuously connected to the main network or systems).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Ensure business continuity and rapid recovery after a cyber incident (e.g., ransomware, data corruption, accidental deletion).\n- Minimize data loss and operational downtime.\n- Prevent backup compromise by isolating backup copies from live systems.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nBackups are a fundamental defense against data loss from cyberattacks, hardware failure, or human error. Storing backups offline reduces the risk that malware or attackers can access or destroy backup copies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has **identified** business-critical systems and essential data for backup.\n- There is **evidence of regular backups** (at least weekly, or more frequent if justified by business needs).\n- Backups are **stored offline** (e.g., on external drives disconnected after backup, or in a secure cloud service with versioning and access controls).\n- There is a **backup plan or policy** covering systems/data included, backup frequency, storage method/location, and recovery process.\n- The organization can **demonstrate** that backup data is protected (e.g., encrypted, access-controlled).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No identification of what data/systems are critical or essential.\n- No evidence of regular backups, or backups are ad-hoc/irregular.\n- Backups are only stored online or on the same network as production systems (e.g., mapped network drives, always-connected NAS).\n- No backup plan/policy, or policy is generic and not implemented.\n- No mention or evidence of backup data protection (e.g., unencrypted, accessible to all staff).\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some but not all critical systems/data are backed up.\n- Backups are performed but not stored offline (e.g., only in cloud storage without proper isolation).\n- Policy exists but is not fully implemented or lacks key details.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- List or inventory of business-critical systems and essential data.\n- Backup schedules/logs/screenshots showing regular backup activity.\n- Description or diagram of backup storage (e.g., external drives, cloud service, physical location).\n- Backup policy or plan document.\n- Evidence of encryption or access controls on backup data.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **current** (within the last 3-6 months).\n- Documentation should be **specific** (names of systems/data, backup frequency, storage method).\n- Screenshots/logs should show **dates/times** and **successful backup completion**.\n- Policy documents should be **dated** and **approved** by management.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not organization-specific.\n- Backups are described but not demonstrated (no logs/screenshots).\n- Policy exists but no proof of implementation.\n- Backups stored on always-connected devices or in insecure locations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Q1: Any backup solution for critical services and data?\n- **What to Look For:** Clear identification of what is backed up and how.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"We back up our accounting system and customer database daily to an encrypted external hard drive, which is disconnected after backup.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"We do backups sometimes.\" / \"We use Google Drive for everything.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"Which systems/data are included in your backups? How do you ensure backups are not accessible to attackers?\"\n\n### Q2: Are backups performed regularly and stored securely?\n- **What to Look For:** Frequency (e.g., daily, weekly), storage method (offline, encrypted).\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Backups are performed every night and stored on a USB drive kept in a locked cabinet.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"Backups are on a shared network folder.\" / \"We back up when we remember.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How often are backups performed? Where are backup copies physically stored?\"\n\n### Q3: What is the backup plan if systems are down or affected?\n- **What to Look For:** Existence of a documented plan for recovery.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"We have a written backup and recovery plan that outlines steps to restore data from offline backups.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"We would try to recover from the cloud.\" / \"No formal plan.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"Can you provide a copy of your backup/recovery plan? When was it last tested?\"\n\n### Q4: Is there a formal backup policy (systems covered, frequency, storage, recovery testing)?\n- **What to Look For:** Existence and content of policy.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Our backup policy (attached) covers all critical systems, requires daily backups, offline storage, and quarterly recovery tests.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"No written policy.\" / \"Policy says to back up, but no details.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"When was the policy last reviewed? Who is responsible for backups?\"\n\n### Q5: Are backup data encrypted?\n- **What to Look For:** Encryption in storage and/or transit.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** \"Backups are encrypted using AES-256 before being stored offline.\"\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** \"No, backups are not encrypted.\" / \"Not sure.\"\n- **Follow-up Questions:** \"How is encryption managed? Who has access to the encryption keys?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), simple solutions (e.g., manual backups to external drives, basic written policy) are acceptable if they meet the core requirements.\n- Larger organizations should have more formalized and automated solutions.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- \"Reasonable effort\" means regular manual backups are acceptable if automated solutions are not feasible, provided they are documented and consistently performed.\n- Use of reputable cloud backup services is acceptable if they provide versioning, access controls, and are not continuously mapped to the main network.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Highly regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more frequent backups and stricter controls.\n- For organizations handling sensitive data, encryption and physical security of backups are especially important.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Only some data/systems are backed up; others are overlooked.\n- Backups are stored on devices always connected to the network (vulnerable to ransomware).\n- No clear identification of what is \"essential\" for business recovery.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Policies are generic, outdated, or not tailored to the organization.\n- No evidence of actual backup activity (e.g., missing logs/screenshots).\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses claim backups are done but provide no supporting evidence.\n- Cloud storage is used as backup, but without proper isolation or access controls.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Has the organization identified business-critical systems and essential data?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Are regular backups performed and documented?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Are backups stored offline or in a manner isolated from production systems?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n4. **Is there a backup plan/policy covering scope, frequency, storage, and recovery?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n5. **Is backup data protected (e.g., encrypted, access-controlled)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n6. **Is evidence current, specific, and credible?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n7. **If all YES → PASS**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or contradictory, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide evidence, escalate to senior auditor for review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable scaling based on size and resources.\n- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, referencing specific evidence and responses.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear identification of essential data/systems, regular and documented backup activity, offline or isolated storage, a written backup plan/policy, and protection of backup data. Evidence must be specific, current, and credible. Adjust expectations for smaller organizations, but do not compromise on the core requirement: essential data must be regularly backed up and stored offline to ensure business recovery after a cyber incident.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must regularly back up their essential data. The frequency of these backups should be determined by the organization’s business needs and the maximum acceptable amount of data loss (i.e., Recovery Point Objective, RPO). For example, if the business can only afford to lose one day’s worth of data, backups should occur at least daily.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure critical business data can be restored in the event of data loss (e.g., ransomware, accidental deletion, hardware failure).\n- Minimize operational disruption by aligning backup frequency with business risk tolerance.\n- Support business continuity and resilience.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nRegular, business-aligned backups are a fundamental defense against data loss. Without them, organizations risk losing essential information, which can severely impact operations, reputation, and compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization performs backups on a regular, defined schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).\n- The backup frequency is explicitly justified based on business requirements and data loss tolerance (e.g., “We back up daily because we can only afford to lose one day’s data”).\n- There is evidence that the backup schedule is followed in practice (e.g., backup logs, schedules, or policies).\n- Essential data (not just some data) is included in the backup scope.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No regular backup schedule is in place, or backups are performed only ad hoc.\n- The backup frequency is arbitrary or not linked to business needs/data loss tolerance.\n- No evidence is provided to support claims of regular backups.\n- Only partial or non-essential data is backed up.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Backups are performed, but the frequency is not clearly justified or only loosely tied to business requirements.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some essential data.\n- The backup schedule is in place but not consistently followed (e.g., missed backups).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Backup schedules or policies (formal or informal, e.g., a written schedule, calendar reminders).\n- Backup logs or reports showing recent backup activity.\n- Screenshots of backup software or cloud backup dashboards.\n- Documentation or statements explaining how backup frequency was determined.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 1-2 months).\n- Evidence should clearly show the frequency and scope of backups.\n- Explanations should be specific (e.g., “We back up every night at 2am because our business can only tolerate 24 hours of data loss”).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague statements (“We back up regularly”) with no supporting details.\n- Outdated evidence (e.g., backup logs from over 3 months ago).\n- Evidence that only covers non-essential or test data.\n- No linkage between backup frequency and business/data loss tolerance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- A clear description of backup frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).\n- A rationale for the chosen frequency, tied to business needs or data loss tolerance.\n- Evidence that backups are actually being performed as described.\n- Confirmation that all essential data is included.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We perform daily backups of all essential business data because we cannot afford to lose more than one day’s work. See attached backup logs from the last two weeks.”\n- “Our business can tolerate up to 3 days of data loss, so we back up every 48 hours. Attached is our backup schedule and screenshots from our backup software.”\n- “We have a weekly backup policy, as our operations can recover from up to 7 days of data loss. Here is our policy document and recent backup reports.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We back up when we remember to.”\n- “We back up sometimes, but don’t have a set schedule.”\n- “We only back up our finance folder, not all essential data.”\n- “No evidence provided.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “How did you determine your backup frequency?”\n- “What data is included in your backups?”\n- “Can you provide recent backup logs or screenshots?”\n- “Who is responsible for ensuring backups are performed?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, informal schedules (e.g., calendar reminders, manual logs) are acceptable if they are consistently followed.\n- The backup method can be simple (e.g., copying files to an external drive) as long as it is regular and covers essential data.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means the organization should have a practical, sustainable backup routine, even if it is manual.\n- Automated solutions are not required, but regularity and coverage are.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations handling sensitive or regulated data may require more frequent backups.\n- For sectors with low data change rates, less frequent backups may be justified if properly explained.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- No formal or informal backup schedule.\n- Backups only cover a subset of essential data.\n- Backup frequency not linked to business needs.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Missing or outdated backup logs.\n- Lack of evidence showing actual backup activity.\n\n### False Positives\n- Stating “we back up regularly” without evidence or justification.\n- Providing evidence of a single backup event, not a pattern.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there a regular backup schedule?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Is the backup frequency justified by business requirements/data loss tolerance?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Is there recent evidence showing backups are performed as scheduled?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n4. **Are all essential data included in the backups?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n5. **If all YES → PASS**\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any evidence, escalate to a senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and justification across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a regular, justified backup routine that matches the organization’s business needs, supported by recent and credible evidence. Responses lacking clear schedules, justification, or evidence should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the requirement for regular, business-aligned backups of all essential data.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that, in addition to backing up essential data, they also back up non-business-critical systems or non-essential information. However, these backups can be performed less frequently (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or as appropriate) and/or retained for longer periods, reflecting their lower criticality.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent data loss from affecting non-essential systems, which may still be needed for compliance, reference, or recovery.\n- Ensure organizational resilience by maintaining the ability to restore less critical data if needed.\n- Reduce risk of total data loss due to ransomware, accidental deletion, or hardware failure.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nWhile essential data is prioritized, non-essential data can still be important for audits, legal requirements, or operational continuity. Even infrequent backups help organizations recover from broader incidents and demonstrate a mature approach to data management.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Organization demonstrates that backups of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information **are performed**, even if at a lower frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually).\n- There is a **defined schedule or policy** for these backups, even if informal.\n- Evidence shows that at least one backup of non-essential data has been performed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within the past year).\n- The backup process is **documented** or can be described clearly by the organization.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Organization does **not perform any backups** of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information.\n- No evidence or description of backup activities for non-essential data.\n- Organization claims non-essential data does not require backup without justification.\n- Backups are only performed for business-critical data, with non-essential data ignored.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Organization has **ad hoc** or irregular backups of non-essential data, but no defined schedule or process.\n- Backups are performed, but not stored offline or not retained for a reasonable period.\n- Organization is in the process of implementing such backups but has not yet completed the process.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some non-essential systems.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Backup schedules, policies, or procedures (even if informal or in email/notes).\n- Backup logs, screenshots, or reports showing non-essential data backups.\n- Inventory/list of non-business-critical systems with backup status.\n- Statements from IT staff describing the backup process for non-essential data.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last 12 months).\n- Should clearly indicate **which systems/data** are considered non-essential and how/when they are backed up.\n- Evidence must be **specific** (not generic statements like \"we back up everything\").\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague or blanket statements with no supporting detail.\n- Evidence only covers business-critical data.\n- Outdated backup logs (older than 12 months).\n- No mention of non-essential data in backup documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear identification of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information.\n- Description of backup frequency (e.g., \"we back up these systems quarterly\").\n- Evidence of at least one backup event for non-essential data.\n- Any policy, schedule, or process—even if informal—covering non-essential data.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We back up our archived email and old project files quarterly to an external hard drive stored offsite.\"\n- \"Non-essential systems are backed up monthly; see attached backup logs for [system name].\"\n- \"Our backup policy (attached) specifies that non-critical data is backed up every six months.\"\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We only back up business-critical data.\"\n- \"Non-essential data is not backed up because it is not important.\"\n- \"We do not have a backup process for non-business-critical systems.\"\n- \"All data is backed up, but we cannot provide evidence for non-essential data.\"\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide an example of a recent backup of non-essential data?\n- How do you determine which systems/data are non-essential?\n- Where are these backups stored, and how often are they performed?\n- Is there any documentation or log showing the last backup of non-essential data?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, informal processes (e.g., manual copying to USB drives) are acceptable if performed and documented.\n- Backup frequency can be lower (e.g., annually) if justified by data criticality and resource constraints.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- \"Reasonable effort\" means at least some non-essential data is backed up, even if infrequently.\n- Automated solutions are not required; manual backups are acceptable.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., legal, healthcare) may have regulatory requirements for retaining non-essential data; auditors should consider this.\n- For organizations with minimal non-essential data, a clear rationale for backup frequency is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming non-essential data does not need any backup.\n- No distinction between essential and non-essential data in backup processes.\n- Backups performed but not stored offline or not retained.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence for non-essential data backups.\n- Outdated or incomplete backup logs.\n- Policies that mention only business-critical data.\n\n### False Positives\n- Statements like \"all data is backed up\" without evidence for non-essential data.\n- Evidence of backup software in use, but no indication of scope or frequency for non-essential data.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Does the organization perform backups of non-business-critical systems or non-essential information?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n2. **Is there evidence (logs, schedules, statements) showing these backups occur, even at a lower frequency?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance (if process is being implemented)\n   - **Yes:** Proceed\n\n3. **Is the backup process for non-essential data defined (even informally) and has at least one backup occurred in the last 12 months?**\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request more evidence or clarification)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims exemption from backing up non-essential data without clear justification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for size and sector as outlined above.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that non-essential data is backed up at a lower frequency, with at least one backup event in the past year. Informal processes are acceptable for small organizations, but there must be some documentation or credible description.

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must implement automated backup processes for essential data wherever it is practical to do so, rather than relying solely on manual backups. This means using built-in or third-party tools to schedule and perform regular backups with minimal human intervention, especially for critical business data.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure essential data is consistently and reliably backed up.\n- Reduce the risk of human error or omission in backup routines.\n- Increase the likelihood of successful data recovery after incidents (e.g., ransomware, accidental deletion).\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nManual backups are prone to being forgotten, skipped, or performed incorrectly. Automation increases reliability and ensures that backups occur as scheduled, which is vital for business continuity and resilience against cyber threats.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization has implemented automated backup processes for all essential data where automation is technically and operationally feasible.\n- Automation is demonstrated for key systems (e.g., servers, cloud storage, critical workstations).\n- Manual backups are only used where automation is genuinely not feasible (e.g., for certain legacy systems or highly mobile devices), and this is clearly justified.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Backups are performed manually when automation is feasible but not implemented.\n- No evidence of automation for any essential data, with no valid justification.\n- The organization is unaware of automation options or has not considered them.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some essential data is backed up automatically, but other critical data is still backed up manually without clear justification.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing automation but has not yet completed it.\n- Automation is claimed but not consistently applied or only covers a small subset of essential data.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of backup software scheduling/configuration screens.\n- Backup logs showing automated execution times/dates.\n- Policy documents or SOPs describing automated backup routines.\n- Vendor documentation or system settings indicating scheduled backups.\n- Exception documentation for systems where automation is not feasible.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).\n- Evidence must clearly show automation (e.g., scheduled tasks, recurring jobs).\n- Documentation should match the organization’s described backup scope and frequency.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague statements without supporting evidence (“We do backups regularly”).\n- Evidence of only ad-hoc/manual backups (e.g., screenshots of manual file copies).\n- Outdated or irrelevant screenshots/logs.\n- No mention of exceptions or rationale for manual processes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear description of which data is backed up and how automation is achieved.\n- Identification of backup tools or built-in OS features used for automation.\n- Evidence that scheduled backups are running as intended.\n- Justification for any manual backup processes.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We use [backup software/cloud service] to automatically back up our server data every night. See attached screenshot of the scheduled backup job and recent backup logs.”\n- “All staff laptops are configured to back up Documents folders to OneDrive automatically. Manual backups are only done for [legacy system], which cannot be automated (see attached justification).”\n- “Our accounting system is backed up daily using Windows Task Scheduler. See attached configuration and log files.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We ask staff to back up their files every week.” (Manual, no automation)\n- “We do backups when we remember.” (No process, no automation)\n- “We plan to automate backups in the future.” (Not yet implemented)\n- “We use USB drives for backups.” (Unless automation is demonstrated, e.g., scheduled imaging)\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Which backup tools or features are used for automation?\n- Can you provide recent logs or screenshots showing scheduled backups?\n- For any manual backups, why is automation not feasible?\n- How do you verify that automated backups are successful?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), automation may be as simple as enabling built-in OS/cloud backup features (e.g., Windows File History, macOS Time Machine, Google Drive/OneDrive sync).\n- Manual backups may be acceptable for isolated, low-risk systems if justified, but automation should be the default for essential data.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Free or low-cost automation tools are acceptable (e.g., built-in OS features, free backup utilities).\n- “Reasonable effort” means using available features rather than purchasing enterprise solutions.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have stricter requirements; however, Cyber Essentials baseline applies to all.\n- For organizations with highly mobile staff, cloud-based automated backups may be more practical.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) is a backup without versioning or offline copy.\n- Relying on staff to remember to back up data.\n- Not automating backups for servers or shared drives.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Screenshots showing only manual backup processes.\n- Logs that do not indicate scheduled/automated activity.\n- Lack of evidence for claimed automation.\n\n### False Positives\n- Describing a process as “automatic” when it is actually manual.\n- Confusing file synchronization with true backup (no versioning, no offline copy).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence of automated backup for all essential data where feasible?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n   - **No:** Go to 2\n\n2. **Are manual backups used only where automation is not feasible, with clear justification?**\n   - **Yes:** PARTIAL (request further evidence/clarification)\n   - **No:** FAIL\n\n3. **Is there any evidence of automation in place?**\n   - **Yes, but incomplete:** PARTIAL (request improvement plan)\n   - **No:** FAIL\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If justification for manual backups is weak or unsupported, request additional evidence or clarification.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for what constitutes “automation” across all organizations.\n- Ensure that exceptions for manual backups are consistently justified and documented.\n- Document all assessment decisions and rationale for transparency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent evidence that automated backup processes are in place for all essential data where feasible. Manual backups should be the exception, not the rule, and must be justified. Responses lacking evidence, relying on manual processes without justification, or describing future plans rather than current practice should result in a FAIL.

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**\n- For organizations using cloud services, they must:\n  - Demonstrate understanding of the shared responsibility model for data backup between themselves and their Cloud Service Provider (CSP).\n  - Clearly define which party (organization or CSP) is responsible for backing up essential data.\n  - Ensure that essential data is actually backed up, either by:\n    - The organization itself (e.g., downloading and storing backups offline or on separate media), or\n    - Using backup services provided by the CSP, or\n    - Using multiple cloud providers for redundancy.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Prevent data loss due to accidental deletion, ransomware, or CSP failure.\n- Ensure recoverability of essential data even if the primary cloud environment is compromised or unavailable.\n- Avoid assumptions that the CSP automatically backs up all data.\n\n**Context and Importance:**\n- Many cloud services operate on a shared responsibility model: the CSP secures the infrastructure, but the customer is often responsible for data backup.\n- Misunderstanding this can lead to critical data loss.\n- Offline or independent backups are a key defense against ransomware and cloud outages.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization can clearly articulate the shared responsibility model for their cloud services (e.g., referencing CSP documentation or agreements).\n- There is evidence that essential data is backed up, either:\n  - By the organization (e.g., periodic downloads to offline storage), or\n  - Through CSP-provided backup services (with confirmation of scope and coverage), or\n  - By using multiple cloud providers for backup.\n- The backup process is documented and covers all essential data in scope.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- The organization cannot explain or demonstrate understanding of the shared responsibility model for backup.\n- There is no evidence of any backup process for cloud data.\n- The organization assumes the CSP handles all backups without verification or documentation.\n- Backups are not performed, or only exist within the same cloud environment without redundancy.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- The organization has some backup measures but lacks clarity on roles/responsibilities or coverage.\n- Backups are performed, but only for some essential data, or backup frequency is unclear.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing proper backups but has not completed the process.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Documentation or policy describing backup responsibilities (e.g., shared responsibility model summary, CSP documentation).\n- Screenshots or logs showing backup jobs, schedules, or confirmation of completed backups.\n- Evidence of offline or independent backups (e.g., external drive inventory, secondary cloud provider receipts).\n- Contracts or service agreements with CSPs specifying backup provisions.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3–6 months).\n- Documentation should be specific to the organization’s actual cloud services and data.\n- Screenshots/logs must show actual backup activity, not just configuration screens.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.\n- Outdated or irrelevant evidence (e.g., old backup logs, unrelated CSP documentation).\n- Evidence that only describes backup features, not actual implementation.\n- No mention of essential data scope or backup frequency.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Clear explanation of which party is responsible for backup (organization vs. CSP).\n- Description of how essential data is identified and backed up.\n- Evidence that backups are performed and stored independently (offline, separate cloud, etc.).\n- Confirmation that backup coverage matches the scope of certification.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “We use Microsoft 365. According to Microsoft’s shared responsibility model, we are responsible for backing up our data. We use a third-party backup service to back up all SharePoint and OneDrive data weekly, with copies stored in a separate cloud account.”\n- “Our CSP provides daily backups of our cloud servers, as confirmed in our service agreement (see attached). We also download monthly snapshots to an encrypted external drive stored offsite.”\n- “We use Google Workspace. We export essential data monthly and store it on an external hard drive kept in a secure location.”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “Our CSP handles all backups for us.” (without evidence or understanding of the shared responsibility model)\n- “We don’t need to back up our cloud data because it’s always available.”\n- “We plan to implement backups soon.”\n- “We only back up some files, not all essential data.”\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- Can you provide documentation or a summary of your CSP’s shared responsibility model for backup?\n- How do you ensure that all essential data is included in your backups?\n- Where are your backups stored, and how often are they performed?\n- Can you show evidence of a recent backup or restoration test?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations, manual backups (e.g., monthly downloads to USB drives) are acceptable if documented and performed regularly.\n- Larger organizations should have more formalized and automated backup processes.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- “Reasonable effort” means using built-in CSP tools or affordable third-party solutions, not enterprise-grade systems.\n- Manual processes are acceptable if they are consistent and cover all essential data.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Highly regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more frequent or robust backups.\n- For organizations handling sensitive data, encrypted backups are recommended.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Assuming CSPs automatically back up all data.\n- Backups only within the same cloud environment (no offline or independent copy).\n- No regular backup schedule or process.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Lack of evidence showing actual backup activity.\n- Policies that are generic or not tailored to the organization’s cloud usage.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Responses that reference backup features but do not show actual use.\n- Evidence of backup configuration without proof of execution.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Does the organization use cloud assets?**\n   - If NO: Provision not applicable.\n   - If YES: Continue.\n2. **Can the organization explain the shared responsibility model for backup?**\n   - If NO: FAIL.\n   - If YES: Continue.\n3. **Is there evidence that essential data is backed up (offline, separate cloud, or via CSP with documented coverage)?**\n   - If NO: FAIL.\n   - If YES: Continue.\n4. **Is the backup process documented and covers all essential data?**\n   - If NO: Partial Compliance (request clarification).\n   - If YES: PASS.\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional documentation.\n- If the organization claims full CSP responsibility, verify with CSP documentation.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and understanding across all organizations of similar size and cloud usage.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Use these criteria to guide your assessment of each self-assessment response for this provision. Ensure that your evaluation is practical, proportionate, and maintains the required security baseline.**",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations that use mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) and/or IoT devices (e.g., sensors, smart cameras) within the certification scope must ensure that essential business data stored on these devices is regularly backed up. For mobile devices, this means enabling automatic backup and transferring data to a secondary device or secure storage (e.g., cloud, secondary phone). For IoT devices, where automatic backup may not be available, essential data must be backed up manually.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent loss of essential business data due to device loss, theft, failure, or compromise.\n- Ensure business continuity by enabling data restoration from backup.\n- Reduce the impact of ransomware or other destructive attacks on mobile/IoT assets.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nMobile and IoT devices are often overlooked in backup strategies but can contain critical business information. Their loss or compromise can disrupt operations or result in data breaches. This provision ensures organizations have a basic, practical backup process for these devices, tailored to their technical limitations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization identifies all mobile and IoT devices in scope.\n- Essential business data on these devices is regularly backed up.\n    - For mobile devices: Automatic backup is enabled (e.g., to cloud or secondary device), or regular manual backup is performed.\n    - For IoT devices: Manual backup procedures are in place and performed at reasonable intervals.\n- Backups are stored in a separate location/device (not just on the original device).\n- The backup process is documented and evidence of recent backups is available.\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No backup process exists for mobile or IoT devices containing essential data.\n- Backups are only stored on the original device (no redundancy).\n- The organization cannot demonstrate that backups have occurred.\n- The organization claims no essential data is stored on these devices, but evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- Backups are performed, but not regularly or only for some devices.\n- Backup process is ad hoc or undocumented.\n- Only some types of essential data are backed up.\n- Evidence is incomplete or outdated.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- Screenshots showing backup settings enabled on mobile devices (e.g., cloud backup, scheduled backups).\n- Logs or records of recent backup activities.\n- Written procedures or policies describing backup frequency and methods for mobile/IoT devices.\n- Photos or documentation of manual backup processes for IoT devices.\n- Inventory of devices and data types backed up.\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).\n- Screenshots/logs must clearly show device identifiers and backup status.\n- Written procedures should be clear, concise, and reflect actual practice.\n- Evidence should match the devices and data types described in the self-assessment.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not device-specific.\n- Screenshots or logs are incomplete or do not show backup success.\n- No evidence of backup for IoT devices where essential data is present.\n- Claims of “no essential data” without supporting justification.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **What to Look For**\n- Clear identification of mobile and IoT devices in use.\n- Description of what constitutes “essential data” on these devices.\n- Explanation of backup methods (automatic/manual, frequency, storage location).\n- Evidence that backup is performed and recent.\n\n### **Acceptable Responses**\n- “All company mobile phones have automatic cloud backup enabled for contacts, SMS, and business app data. Screenshots attached.”\n- “IoT sensors in our warehouse store operational logs. These are manually downloaded to a secure server weekly. Backup logs attached.”\n- “We use WhatsApp for client communications on mobile devices; chat backups are scheduled daily to Google Drive.”\n\n### **Unacceptable Responses**\n- “We don’t back up mobile phones, but we haven’t lost any data yet.”\n- “IoT devices are not backed up because it’s too difficult.”\n- “We don’t think there’s any essential data on our devices” (without justification or inventory).\n- “Backups are done sometimes, but we don’t keep records.”\n\n### **Follow-up Questions**\n- Can you provide a screenshot or log of the most recent backup for a representative device?\n- How do you determine which data is essential on your mobile/IoT devices?\n- Where are backups stored, and how do you ensure they are not on the same device?\n- How often are manual backups performed for IoT devices?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), a simple manual backup process (e.g., weekly download to a USB drive or cloud storage) is acceptable if documented and performed regularly.\n- For organizations with only a few devices, evidence for each device should be provided.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Use of built-in cloud backup features (e.g., Google/iCloud) is acceptable and encouraged.\n- Manual backup for IoT devices is sufficient if automation is not feasible.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- In sectors with sensitive data (e.g., healthcare), backup frequency and security should be proportionate to data criticality.\n- For organizations with only consumer-grade IoT devices, a simple manual process is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- Overlooking essential data stored in messaging apps or contacts.\n- Assuming cloud sync (e.g., email) is a backup without verifying coverage of all essential data.\n- Not backing up IoT device data at all.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Lack of evidence for manual backups.\n- Outdated screenshots or logs.\n- No written backup procedure.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Claiming “automatic backup enabled” without evidence.\n- Providing evidence for only some devices or data types.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Are mobile/IoT devices in scope and do they store essential data?**\n    - If NO: Confirm with inventory and justification. PASS if justified.\n    - If YES: Proceed.\n2. **Is there a documented backup process for these devices?**\n    - If NO: FAIL.\n    - If YES: Proceed.\n3. **Is there recent evidence of backup (screenshots, logs, records)?**\n    - If NO: FAIL.\n    - If YES: Proceed.\n4. **Are backups stored separately from the original device?**\n    - If NO: FAIL.\n    - If YES: PASS.\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request clarification or additional evidence.\n- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims “no essential data” but this is questionable.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across all organizations of similar size and device usage.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and device-specific evidence that essential data on mobile and IoT devices is regularly backed up and stored separately. Accept reasonable, practical approaches for small organizations, but do not accept undocumented, ad hoc, or unsubstantiated claims. Use the decision tree and follow-up questions to ensure consistent, fair, and thorough evaluation.",

Backups should minimally be password-protected.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \n- All essential data backups (including offline backups) must be protected so that only authorised personnel can access them.\n- At a minimum, backups must be password-protected.\n- The organization must demonstrate that access controls are in place for backup data, whether stored on physical media (e.g., USB drives, external hard disks) or in cloud/offsite locations.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent unauthorised access, theft, or tampering with backup data.\n- Ensure that, in the event of a cyber incident, backups remain a reliable and uncompromised source for recovery.\n- Reduce risk of data breaches via backup compromise.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nBackups are a prime target for attackers. If not properly protected, they can be accessed, deleted, or used to extort the organization. Password protection and access restriction are baseline controls that significantly reduce this risk, especially for organizations with limited resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Backups (both online and offline) are protected by at least password protection.\n- Access to backups is limited to a defined set of authorised personnel.\n- The organization can describe or show how backup access is controlled (e.g., password, encryption, physical lock, access list).\n- Evidence supports that controls are in place and in use.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Backups are not password-protected or otherwise access-controlled.\n- All staff or unauthorised individuals can access backups.\n- No evidence or only vague statements about backup protection.\n- Organization cannot identify who is authorised to access backups.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Backups are password-protected, but access controls are informal or not documented.\n- Some, but not all, backups are protected.\n- Passwords are weak, shared widely, or not changed when staff leave.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers some backup types/locations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots/photos of backup software settings showing password/encryption enabled.\n- Written procedures or policies listing authorised personnel for backup access.\n- Access logs or audit trails (if available).\n- Photos of physical storage (e.g., locked cabinet for external drives).\n- List of backup locations and protection methods.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).\n- Evidence must clearly show password protection or access restriction.\n- If written, must specify who is authorised and how access is managed.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Generic statements (“We keep backups safe”) with no supporting detail.\n- Evidence showing default or weak passwords (e.g., “1234”, “password”).\n- Evidence is outdated or refers to former staff.\n- No mention of offline backup protection.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear description of how backups are protected (password, encryption, physical security).\n- Identification of who is authorised to access backups.\n- Evidence that matches the described controls.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Backups are stored on an encrypted external drive, kept in a locked cabinet. Only the IT manager and director have the key and password.”\n- “Cloud backups are protected by unique passwords and only accessible to the IT administrator. Access is reviewed quarterly.”\n- Screenshot of backup software showing password/encryption enabled.\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We keep backups in the office.”\n- “Everyone can access the backup drive if needed.”\n- “We don’t use passwords for backups, but we trust our staff.”\n- No evidence or only a policy with no proof of implementation.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Who specifically is authorised to access backups?\n- How are passwords managed and changed?\n- Are all backup types (cloud, USB, external HDD) protected?\n- How is access reviewed or updated when staff change roles or leave?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), it is acceptable if only the owner/manager has access, provided this is documented and password protection is in place.\n- For larger organizations, expect a documented list of authorised personnel.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Password protection is the minimum; encryption is encouraged but not required.\n- Physical security (locked drawer/cabinet) is acceptable for offline backups if access is limited.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should be encouraged to use stronger controls, but minimum standard is password protection and access restriction.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Backups are password-protected, but passwords are shared with all staff.\n- No process for updating access when staff leave.\n- Offline backups left unsecured in shared spaces.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- No evidence of access restriction (e.g., no list of authorised personnel).\n- Outdated evidence (e.g., screenshots from years ago).\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy states backups are protected, but no evidence of actual implementation.\n- Password protection is claimed, but passwords are weak or default.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are all backups (online and offline) protected by at least password protection?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → Continue\n\n2. **Is access to backups restricted to authorised personnel only?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → Continue\n\n3. **Is there credible, current evidence supporting both password protection and access restriction?**\n   - If NO → FAIL or PARTIAL (if some evidence exists)\n   - If YES → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request clarification or additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence, escalate to senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for size and reasonable resource constraints.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, practical evidence that all essential data backups are protected by at least password protection and that access is limited to authorised personnel. Responses must be supported by current, credible evidence. Resource constraints are considered, but minimum standards must be met for a PASS.",

Where feasible, backups should be stored offsite, e.g., separate physical location.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must ensure that essential data backups are not only created but are also stored in a manner that is physically or logically separated (“offline”) from the main operating environment. Where possible, these backups should also be kept offsite (in a different physical location from the primary systems).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Prevent loss of critical data due to ransomware, malware, or physical disasters affecting the main environment.\n- Ensure recoverability of essential data even if the primary environment is compromised.\n- Reduce risk of simultaneous compromise of both live data and backups.\n\n**Context and Importance:**  \nStoring backups offline and/or offsite is a fundamental defense against threats like ransomware, which can encrypt both live data and connected backups. Offline/offsite storage ensures that, even in the event of a major incident, the organization can restore essential operations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization demonstrates that essential data backups are stored offline (i.e., not continuously connected to the operating environment).\n- There is clear separation between the backup storage and the primary operating environment (e.g., backups on external drives disconnected after backup, or cloud backups with access controls preventing automatic overwrite).\n- Where feasible, backups are stored offsite (e.g., at a different physical location, or in a secure cloud service not directly accessible from the main network).\n- The process is documented and evidence supports regular implementation.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- Backups are stored only on devices or locations that are always connected to the operating environment (e.g., network shares, always-connected external drives).\n- No evidence of offline or offsite storage.\n- Backups are stored on the same physical premises and are not protected from local disasters.\n- The organization cannot describe or evidence how backups are separated from the main environment.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Backups are stored offline but not offsite, and the organization provides a reasonable justification (e.g., very small business, no feasible offsite option).\n- Backups are stored offsite but not fully offline, with some mitigating controls.\n- The organization is in the process of implementing offline/offsite backups, with a clear and imminent timeline.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Backup policy or procedure documentation describing offline/offsite storage.\n- Screenshots or logs showing backup jobs to external/offline media or offsite/cloud locations.\n- Photos of physical backup media (e.g., external drives, tapes) and their storage location.\n- Service agreements or invoices for offsite/cloud backup services.\n- Inventory of backup media and storage locations.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be current (within the last 3-6 months).\n- Documentation should clearly indicate the separation/offline/offsite nature of backups.\n- Evidence should match the organization’s described backup process.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is generic, outdated, or not specific to the organization.\n- Descriptions are vague (“we back up to the cloud” without details).\n- No proof of separation or offsite storage.\n- Evidence shows backup devices are always connected or stored in the same room as primary systems.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Clear description of how and where backups are stored.\n- Indication that backups are not always connected to the main network.\n- Mention of offsite storage (e.g., cloud, secondary office, secure third-party facility).\n- Evidence that supports the described process.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “We back up essential data daily to an external hard drive, which is disconnected and stored in a locked cabinet after each backup. Once a week, a copy is taken to a manager’s home.”\n- “Backups are performed to a cloud service with multi-factor authentication and are not mapped to any local drives.”\n- “We use a third-party backup provider; backups are encrypted and stored in a different data center.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We back up to a network drive on the same server.”\n- “Backups are stored on an external drive that is always plugged in.”\n- “We don’t have offsite backups, but we plan to do this in the future.”\n- “We use cloud storage, but it is always synced and accessible from all computers.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- How often are backups disconnected or moved offsite?\n- Who is responsible for managing and verifying offline/offsite backups?\n- Can you provide a recent example or log of a backup being stored offline/offsite?\n- How do you ensure that backups are not accessible if the main environment is compromised?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, using external hard drives or USB sticks stored at a staff member’s home or in a secure offsite location is acceptable.\n- Larger organizations should have more formalized processes and may use cloud or third-party offsite backup services.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means at least one backup copy is kept offline or offsite, even if manual (e.g., weekly rotation of drives).\n- Automated solutions are not required if cost-prohibitive, but manual processes must be reliable and documented.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Highly regulated sectors may require more frequent or robust offsite backups.\n- Organizations handling sensitive data should ensure encryption of offsite backups.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming cloud backups are “offline” without proper access controls.\n- Backups stored on always-connected devices.\n- No offsite backup due to perceived inconvenience.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of written backup procedures.\n- Evidence not showing actual separation/offsite storage.\n\n### False Positives\n- Descriptions of backup processes without supporting evidence.\n- “We use cloud backup” with no details on separation or access controls.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are backups stored offline (not always connected to the operating environment)?**\n   - If YES, proceed to next step.\n   - If NO, FAIL.\n\n2. **Are backups stored offsite (separate physical location or secure cloud), or is there a reasonable justification for not doing so?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, but offline storage is implemented, consider PARTIAL COMPLIANCE.\n   - If NO to both, FAIL.\n\n3. **Is there sufficient, credible evidence supporting the described process?**\n   - If YES, PASS.\n   - If NO, FAIL or escalate for further review.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- Unclear or contradictory evidence.\n- Organization claims compliance but cannot provide supporting documentation.\n- Unusual backup arrangements not covered by standard guidance.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for any partial compliance or exceptions.\n- When in doubt, seek senior auditor input or request additional evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, credible evidence that essential data backups are stored offline and, where feasible, offsite. Acceptable solutions may be simple for small organizations but must demonstrate real separation from the operating environment. Responses lacking detail, evidence, or showing always-connected backups should result in a FAIL. Use the decision tree and practical considerations to ensure fair, consistent, and proportionate assessments.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.8.4i  \n**Clause:** Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential data and store them offline  \n**Provision Requirement:** Frequent backups such as daily or weekly backups should be stored online to facilitate quick recovery, e.g., cloud backup storage.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must perform frequent (at least weekly, ideally daily) backups of essential data and ensure that these backups are stored online (e.g., in cloud storage or on a networked backup server) to enable rapid restoration in case of data loss or incident.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure business continuity by enabling quick recovery from data loss, ransomware, or system failure.\n- Minimize downtime and data loss by having recent, accessible backups.\n- Reduce the impact of cyber incidents by maintaining up-to-date, restorable copies of essential data.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nStoring frequent backups online (in addition to any offline backups) is critical for rapid recovery. Offline backups protect against ransomware, but online backups allow for quick restoration, which is vital for operational resilience, especially for organizations with limited IT resources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization performs backups of essential data at least weekly (preferably daily).\n- Backups are stored online (e.g., cloud storage, network-attached storage, or other accessible online platforms).\n- The backup process is documented and evidence of recent backups is available.\n- The organization can describe or demonstrate how quick recovery would be performed using these online backups.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of frequent (at least weekly) backups.\n- Backups are only stored offline (e.g., on USB drives or external hard disks not connected to the network/cloud).\n- No online backup solution is in place.\n- The organization cannot provide evidence or a credible description of online backup and recovery processes.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Backups are performed, but less frequently than weekly.\n- Online backups exist, but only for a subset of essential data.\n- The process is ad-hoc or undocumented.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Screenshots of backup software dashboards showing recent backup dates and storage locations.\n- Backup logs or reports indicating frequency and destination (e.g., cloud provider, network share).\n- Written procedures or policies describing the backup schedule and storage method.\n- Contracts or invoices from cloud backup providers (if applicable).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be recent (within the last month for daily/weekly backups).\n- Documentation should clearly indicate that backups are stored online and are accessible for quick recovery.\n- Screenshots/logs should show backup dates, frequency, and storage location.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is outdated (older than one month).\n- Only generic statements are provided without supporting documentation.\n- Evidence does not specify storage location or frequency.\n- Screenshots or logs are incomplete, cropped, or appear fabricated.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question: **Are frequent backups stored online for quick recovery?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that backups are performed at least weekly (preferably daily).\n- Confirmation that backups are stored online (cloud, network-attached storage, etc.).\n- Evidence that demonstrates both the frequency and the online nature of the backups.\n- Description of how quick recovery would be performed using these backups.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We perform daily backups of our essential data to [cloud provider] and can restore files within hours. Attached are screenshots of our backup dashboard showing daily backups to the cloud.\"\n- \"Weekly backups are automatically saved to our network-attached storage, accessible by IT for quick restoration. See attached backup logs from the past four weeks.\"\n- \"Our backup policy mandates daily backups to [cloud service], and here is our backup schedule and recent backup report.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We back up data to external hard drives once a month.\" (Offline only, not frequent enough)\n- \"We have a backup process but do not use any online storage.\" (No online backup)\n- \"We plan to implement online backups in the future.\" (Not currently implemented)\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- \"Can you provide a screenshot or log showing the most recent online backup?\"\n- \"What data is included in your online backups?\"\n- \"How quickly can you restore data from your online backup?\"\n- \"Is the backup process automated or manual?\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple cloud backup solution (e.g., Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox) is acceptable if it is used regularly and covers essential data.\n- Manual backups are acceptable if performed at least weekly and stored online.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- The solution should be proportionate: low-cost or free cloud services are acceptable for small organizations.\n- Documentation can be simple (e.g., a backup schedule in a spreadsheet), but must be current and accurate.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Organizations handling sensitive or regulated data may require more robust solutions, but for most Cyber Essentials applicants, basic cloud or networked backups are sufficient.\n- Sector-specific data (e.g., medical, financial) may require additional evidence of compliance with industry regulations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Backups are performed but only stored offline.\n- Backups are infrequent (monthly or ad-hoc).\n- Only some essential data is backed up online.\n- No evidence of recent backups.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of backup logs or schedules.\n- Evidence does not specify storage location.\n- Outdated or generic documentation.\n\n### False Positives\n- Claiming to use cloud storage but only for file sharing, not for systematic backups.\n- Screenshots showing backup software but no indication of online storage or frequency.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are backups performed at least weekly?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n2. **Are backups stored online (cloud or networked storage)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n3. **Is there recent, credible evidence of online backups?**\n   - If NO → FAIL or Partial (request more evidence)\n   - If YES → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or incomplete, request clarification or additional documentation.\n- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide evidence, escalate to a senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same criteria to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and resources.\n- Document reasons for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must demonstrate that frequent (at least weekly) backups of essential data are stored online and can be quickly restored, with recent and credible evidence provided. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept lack of online backups or infrequent backup schedules. Always require evidence that is recent, specific, and clearly shows compliance with the provision.",

Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**\n- The organization must perform longer-term (e.g., monthly) backups of essential data.\n- These backups must be stored **offline** (i.e., not connected to the main network or internet) in an **external, secure storage location**.\n- Acceptable storage media include password-protected USB flash drives, encrypted external hard disks, or tape storage.\n- The storage location should ideally be physically separate from the main office (e.g., an alternative office or secure offsite location).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Ensure that critical data can be recovered in the event of ransomware, cyberattack, or physical disaster.\n- Prevent backups from being compromised if the main network is breached.\n- Reduce risk of data loss due to single-point-of-failure or simultaneous compromise.\n\n**Context/Importance:**\n- Offline, offsite backups are a fundamental defense against ransomware and catastrophic incidents.\n- This provision is especially important for organizations with limited IT resources, as it provides a simple, effective recovery option.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- Organization confirms that longer-term (e.g., monthly) backups are performed.\n- Backups are stored **offline** (not connected to the network/internet when not in use).\n- Backups are kept in a **secure external location** (e.g., locked cabinet, alternative office, or secure offsite facility).\n- Storage media are **protected** (e.g., password-protected, encrypted).\n- Evidence (e.g., backup logs, photos, inventory lists) supports the claim.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of offline backups being performed.\n- Backups are only stored online, on network-attached storage, or in cloud services without offline copies.\n- Storage media are not protected (e.g., unencrypted, no password).\n- Backups are kept in the same physical location as the primary data without additional security.\n- No supporting evidence provided.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Backups are performed and stored offline, but security controls (encryption/password) are weak or inconsistently applied.\n- Storage location is not clearly external or secure.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear.\n- In such cases, request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Backup schedules or logs indicating monthly/offline backups.\n- Photos of backup devices (with identifying labels, if possible).\n- Inventory lists of backup media and storage locations.\n- Written procedures or policies describing backup and storage practices.\n- Receipts or documentation for offsite storage services (if used).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 3-6 months).\n- Documentation should be specific (e.g., dates, device types, storage locations).\n- Photos or logs should not reveal sensitive data but should demonstrate actual practice.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Vague statements without supporting documentation.\n- Evidence is outdated or generic (e.g., template policies not tailored to the organization).\n- Photos or logs appear staged or inconsistent with described practices.\n- No mention of security controls (encryption/passwords) on backup media.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Confirmation of **monthly** (or longer-term) backup frequency.\n- Description of **offline** storage (e.g., \"USB drive is disconnected and locked away after backup\").\n- Details of **external, secure location** (e.g., \"stored in a locked cabinet at manager’s home/alternative office\").\n- Mention of **security controls** (e.g., password protection, encryption).\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We perform monthly backups of our essential data to an encrypted external hard drive, which is stored in a locked cabinet at our director’s home.\"\n- \"Backups are made to a password-protected USB drive, which is kept offsite at our accountant’s office.\"\n- Evidence: Backup logs showing monthly entries, photos of labeled backup devices, inventory lists, or written backup procedures.\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We back up to Google Drive/OneDrive\" (cloud-only, not offline).\n- \"Backups are stored on a network drive in the office\" (not offline or external).\n- \"We have a USB backup, but it stays plugged into the server\" (not offline).\n- No evidence or only generic policy statements.\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- Where exactly are the backup devices stored when not in use?\n- Are the backup devices encrypted or password-protected?\n- Who has access to the backup storage location?\n- Can you provide a recent backup log or photo of the backup device and storage location?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, it is acceptable for backups to be stored at a trusted staff member’s home, provided the device is secured (locked, password-protected/encrypted).\n- The process should be simple but must meet the offline and security requirements.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Use of affordable encrypted USB drives or external hard disks is sufficient.\n- No need for enterprise-grade solutions, but basic security (password/encryption, physical security) is required.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance), stronger encryption and stricter access controls may be expected.\n- For low-risk sectors, basic password protection and physical security may suffice.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Backups are performed but not stored offline or offsite.\n- Devices are not secured (no password/encryption).\n- Only cloud backups are used, with no offline copy.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of evidence for actual backup practice (e.g., no logs, no photos).\n- Outdated or generic policies not reflecting current practice.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that mention \"backups\" but do not specify offline, external, or secure storage.\n- Claims of \"secure\" storage without describing controls or location.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are longer-term backups performed?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n2. **Are backups stored offline (disconnected from network/internet)?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n3. **Are backups stored in an external, secure location?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n4. **Are backup devices protected (password/encryption)?**\n   - If NO → Partial Compliance (request clarification); if YES → proceed\n5. **Is there credible, recent evidence supporting the above?**\n   - If NO → Partial Compliance (request evidence); if YES → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting documentation, escalate for further review.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and sector.\n- Document rationale for each decision, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, credible evidence that longer-term backups are performed, stored offline, and kept in a secure, external location with appropriate protection. Responses lacking these elements, or without supporting evidence, should be marked as FAIL or Partial Compliance, with follow-up as needed.

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must test their backup restoration process at least twice a year (bi-annually) to confirm that essential data and business-critical systems can be restored successfully. This means not only creating backups but also verifying, through actual restoration tests, that these backups are usable and effective.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure that backup data is reliable and can be restored in the event of data loss, ransomware, or system failure.\n- Minimize business disruption by confirming that restoration processes work as intended.\n- Identify and address any issues with backup integrity or restoration procedures before an actual incident occurs.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nTesting backups is critical because untested backups may be incomplete, corrupted, or unusable when needed. Regular testing is a baseline control to ensure business continuity and resilience against common cyber threats.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization conducts backup restoration tests at least every six months (bi-annually) or more frequently.\n- Tests include actual restoration of data (not just verification that backups exist).\n- Evidence demonstrates that tests cover business-critical systems and essential data.\n- There is documentation or records of the most recent backup tests, including dates and outcomes.\n- Any issues found during tests are documented and addressed.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of backup restoration tests being conducted in the past 12 months.\n- Tests are only theoretical or involve checking backup files exist, without actual restoration.\n- Restoration tests are ad hoc, irregular, or not scheduled.\n- No documentation or records of backup tests.\n- Tests do not cover business-critical systems or essential data.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Restoration tests are conducted, but less frequently than bi-annually (e.g., only once a year).\n- Tests are performed, but documentation is incomplete or missing key details (e.g., no outcomes recorded).\n- Only some critical systems/data are tested, not all.\n- Organization claims to test but cannot provide sufficient evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Backup test logs or reports showing dates, systems/data tested, and results.\n- Screenshots or records from backup software indicating restoration tests.\n- Meeting minutes, emails, or calendar invites confirming test activities.\n- Incident or issue logs showing follow-up actions from failed tests.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be dated and clearly show that tests occurred within the last 6 months (or at least twice in the last 12 months).\n- Should specify what data/systems were restored and the outcome (success/failure).\n- Evidence should be attributable to the organization (not generic vendor documentation).\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated, generic, or not specific to the organization.\n- Only backup schedules or backup existence is shown, with no restoration test proof.\n- Evidence is outdated (older than 6 months).\n- Fabricated or template documents with no real details.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Question: **Are backups tested at least bi-annually to ensure effective restoration?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Clear statement that restoration tests are performed at least every 6 months.\n- Description of the restoration process and what is tested.\n- Dates and outcomes of the last two tests.\n- Evidence supporting the claim (see above).\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- \"We conduct restoration tests every March and September. Our last test was on 15 March 2024, where we restored our finance and HR databases successfully. Attached are the test logs and screenshots from our backup software.\"\n- \"Backup restoration is tested twice a year as per our IT schedule. The most recent test was on 1 June 2024, covering all business-critical systems. See attached report.\"\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- \"We back up our data regularly.\" (No mention of restoration testing.)\n- \"We check that backups exist every month.\" (No restoration.)\n- \"We did a test last year.\" (Only one test in 12 months.)\n- \"No evidence provided.\"\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- Can you provide logs or reports from your most recent restoration test?\n- Which systems and data are included in your restoration tests?\n- What issues, if any, were identified during your last test, and how were they addressed?\n- Who is responsible for conducting and documenting these tests?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, restoration tests may be manual and less formal, but there must still be evidence (e.g., screenshots, simple logs, or emails confirming the test).\n- The scope of testing should be proportionate to the size and complexity of the organization but must include all essential data and systems.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept simple, low-cost evidence (e.g., annotated screenshots, basic logs) if formal reports are not feasible.\n- Restoration tests can be performed by non-specialist staff if documented.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For organizations with highly sensitive or regulated data, more rigorous testing may be expected.\n- For sectors with minimal IT infrastructure, ensure at least the most critical data (e.g., customer records, financial data) is included in tests.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Confusing backup creation with restoration testing.\n- Only testing a subset of data, ignoring critical systems.\n- Infrequent or ad hoc testing.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Missing or outdated test records.\n- Evidence that does not specify what was restored or the test outcome.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that describe backup schedules but not restoration.\n- Evidence that is generic or not organization-specific.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Has the organization provided evidence of at least two restoration tests in the past 12 months?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to next check.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Do the tests cover business-critical systems and essential data?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to next check.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.\n\n3. **Is the evidence credible, dated, and organization-specific?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL.\n\n4. **Were any issues found during tests addressed?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance (if issues not addressed).\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If only partial compliance is demonstrated, seek clarification or additional documentation.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for frequency, scope, and evidence quality across all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, dated evidence of at least bi-annual restoration tests covering all essential data and systems. Accept proportionate, practical evidence for smaller organizations, but do not accept mere backup existence or schedules without restoration testing. Incomplete, outdated, or generic evidence should result in a FAIL or request for further information. Use the decision tree to ensure consistent, fair, and thorough assessments.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Provision Overview**\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must have a **basic, up-to-date incident response plan (IRP)** that guides how to detect, respond to, and recover from common cybersecurity incidents (e.g., phishing, ransomware, data breach). The plan must clearly define:\n- **Roles and responsibilities** of key personnel involved in incident response.\n- **Step-by-step procedures** for detection, response, and recovery from typical cyber threats.\n- A **communication plan** with timelines for escalating and reporting incidents to relevant internal and external stakeholders (e.g., management, regulators, customers).\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**\n- Ensure the organization can **quickly identify and contain incidents** to minimize damage.\n- Enable **coordinated and effective response** by assigning clear responsibilities.\n- Maintain **transparency and compliance** through timely communication with stakeholders.\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \nWithout a clear, actionable IRP, organizations are likely to respond slowly or ineffectively to incidents, increasing the risk of data loss, business disruption, regulatory penalties, and reputational harm.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Evaluation Framework**\n\n### **PASS Criteria**\n- The organization provides a **written incident response plan** (document, policy, or procedure) that is **current** (reviewed/updated within the last 12 months).\n- The plan **explicitly lists roles and responsibilities** (e.g., who leads the response, who communicates with stakeholders, who investigates).\n- The plan includes **detection, response, and recovery procedures** for at least the following scenarios: phishing, ransomware, and data breach.\n- There is a **communication/escalation plan** with clear timelines and identification of who is notified (internally and externally).\n- Employees are **aware of how to report suspicious activity** (e.g., phishing emails).\n\n### **FAIL Criteria**\n- No incident response plan exists, or only informal/unwritten processes are described.\n- The plan is **outdated** (not reviewed in the last 12 months) or missing key elements (roles, procedures, communication).\n- The plan is generic, lacks actionable steps, or does not address common threat scenarios.\n- No evidence of employee awareness or reporting process for incidents.\n\n### **Partial Compliance**\n- The plan exists but is missing one or more required elements (e.g., no communication plan, unclear roles).\n- The plan is not tailored to the organization’s actual structure or operations.\n- The plan is in draft form or not yet communicated to staff.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**\n\n### **Required Evidence Types**\n- **Incident Response Plan document** (policy, procedure, or playbook).\n- **Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan** (if referenced as part of IRP).\n- **Employee communications/training records** (e.g., email, intranet post, training slides) showing staff are informed about reporting procedures.\n- **Incident reporting forms or logs** (if available).\n\n### **Evidence Quality Standards**\n- **Specificity:** The plan should reference the organization’s actual structure, not generic templates.\n- **Currency:** The plan should show a recent review date (within 12 months).\n- **Completeness:** All required elements (roles, procedures, communication) are present.\n- **Accessibility:** The plan is available to relevant staff.\n\n### **Red Flags**\n- Plan is a downloaded template with no customization.\n- No evidence of review or update.\n- Plan is missing key sections or is only a high-level statement.\n- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or inconsistent with organization size/structure.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**\n\n### **Q1: Is there a process for employees to report suspicious emails or attachments?**\n- **What to Look For:** Clear description of how employees report (e.g., dedicated email, helpdesk ticket, escalation to IT).\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “Employees forward suspicious emails to itsecurity@company.com”; “Staff are trained to use the ‘Report Phishing’ button.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “Staff know to be careful”; “We tell people to be vigilant” (no process described).\n- **Follow-up Questions:** How are employees informed of this process? Is there evidence of recent communication or training?\n\n### **Q2: Do floods or other natural occurrences affect operations? If so, what is the disaster-recovery plan?**\n- **What to Look For:** Reference to disaster recovery/business continuity as part of the IRP, especially for data loss scenarios.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “Our BCP includes recovery steps for data loss due to disasters”; “Backups are stored offsite.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “We don’t have a plan”; “Not applicable” (if physical risks are present).\n- **Follow-up Questions:** Is the disaster recovery plan integrated with the incident response plan?\n\n### **Q3: Is there a business-continuity plan in place?**\n- **What to Look For:** Existence of a BCP that complements the IRP, especially for recovery from major incidents.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, see attached BCP document.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No”; “We rely on ad-hoc measures.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:** How does the BCP link to the incident response process?\n\n### **Q4: Is there an incident-response plan (IRP) for cybersecurity and data breaches?**\n- **What to Look For:** Existence of a documented IRP covering cyber incidents.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “Yes, see attached IRP”; “Our IRP covers phishing, ransomware, and data breaches.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “No formal plan”; “We handle incidents as they arise.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:** When was the IRP last reviewed or updated?\n\n### **Q5: Does the incident-response plan include responsibilities of key personnel, procedures to detect, respond and recover from the threat and a communication timeline?**\n- **What to Look For:** Plan sections or tables listing roles, step-by-step procedures, and communication/escalation timelines.\n- **Acceptable Responses:** “The IRP assigns the IT Manager as Incident Lead, details steps for isolating affected systems, and includes a notification matrix.”\n- **Unacceptable Responses:** “We all help out as needed”; “No specific roles or timelines.”\n- **Follow-up Questions:** Who is responsible for each step? How are external parties notified?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical Considerations**\n\n### **Organization Size Scaling**\n- For very small organizations, a concise IRP (1–2 pages) is acceptable if it covers all required elements.\n- Roles may be combined (e.g., owner is also IT lead), but must be explicitly stated.\n\n### **Resource Constraints**\n- Simple, practical procedures are acceptable (e.g., “call IT support”).\n- Use of checklists or flowcharts is encouraged for clarity.\n\n### **Industry Context**\n- Highly regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require more detailed communication plans.\n- For organizations with no customer data, focus on internal escalation and recovery.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**\n\n### **Typical Compliance Gaps**\n- IRP is missing or only covers IT outages, not cyber incidents.\n- No assignment of roles or unclear responsibilities.\n- No communication/escalation plan.\n\n### **Documentation Issues**\n- Plan is outdated or undated.\n- Evidence is a generic template with no organization-specific details.\n- No proof that staff are aware of the plan.\n\n### **False Positives**\n- Responses claim a plan exists but provide no supporting document.\n- Plan mentions “cybersecurity” but only covers physical disasters.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Scoring Guidance**\n\n### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**\n1. **Is there a documented IRP covering cyber incidents?**\n   - **No:** FAIL\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n2. **Does the IRP assign roles/responsibilities, include procedures for detection/response/recovery, and a communication plan with timelines?**\n   - **No:** FAIL or PARTIAL (if some elements present)\n   - **Yes:** Continue\n3. **Is the IRP current (reviewed/updated within 12 months) and organization-specific?**\n   - **No:** PARTIAL (request update)\n   - **Yes:** PASS\n\n### **Escalation Criteria**\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- Escalate to senior auditor if organization disputes requirements or if sector-specific obligations are unclear.\n\n### **Consistency Standards**\n- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for any PARTIAL or escalated cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for a concise, up-to-date, and actionable incident response plan that clearly assigns roles, outlines procedures for common cyber threats, and includes a communication/escalation process. Evidence must be organization-specific and demonstrate staff awareness. Adjust expectations for organization size and resources, but do not accept missing or generic plans. Use the decision tree to ensure consistent, fair, and thorough assessments.",

Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.9.4b  \n**Clause: Respond: Incident response – Be ready to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents**  \n**Provision Requirement:** The incident response plan shall be made aware to all employees in the organisation that have access to the organisation’s IT assets and/or environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nAll employees who have access to the organization’s IT assets or environment must be made aware of the incident response plan. This means employees should know:\n- That an incident response plan exists,\n- Their role or responsibility in the event of an incident,\n- How to report incidents, and\n- Where to find or access the plan if needed.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure rapid and coordinated response to cybersecurity incidents.\n- Minimize damage and recovery time by ensuring all relevant staff know what to do.\n- Reduce risk of incidents going unreported or mishandled due to lack of awareness.\n\n**Context/Importance:**  \nAwareness is critical for effective incident response. Even a well-written plan is ineffective if employees are unaware of its existence or their responsibilities. This is especially important for organizations with limited IT resources, as every staff member may play a key role in early detection and response.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides clear evidence that all employees with IT access have been informed about the incident response plan.\n- There is a defined process or method for communicating the plan (e.g., onboarding, periodic training, email notifications, staff meetings).\n- The organization can demonstrate that awareness activities have occurred within the last 12 months.\n- Employees know how to report incidents and where to find the plan.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence or only vague statements that employees are aware of the plan.\n- Awareness is limited to IT staff or management, not all relevant employees.\n- No process or ad-hoc communication (e.g., “We tell them if something happens”).\n- No recent awareness activities or evidence is outdated.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- Some, but not all, employees have been made aware.\n- Awareness activities are informal or one-off with no ongoing process.\n- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of staff.\n- The process is described but not implemented or evidenced.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Records of staff communications (e.g., emails, memos, meeting minutes).\n- Training materials or attendance logs.\n- Onboarding checklists referencing incident response awareness.\n- Screenshots of intranet posts or staff portals.\n- Staff acknowledgement forms or e-signatures.\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be dated and cover all relevant staff.\n- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).\n- Evidence should clearly reference the incident response plan.\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated or generic (e.g., “We tell staff verbally”).\n- Only policy documents are provided, with no proof of communication.\n- Evidence only covers a subset of employees (e.g., IT team only).\n- Evidence is fabricated or appears inconsistent (e.g., identical signatures, missing dates).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### Self-Assessment Question:  \n**Are all employees aware of the incident response plan? How do you make sure?**\n\n#### What to Look For\n- Description of how awareness is achieved (e.g., training, onboarding, regular reminders).\n- Evidence that all relevant employees (not just IT) are included.\n- Specifics on frequency and method of communication.\n- Reference to reporting procedures and access to the plan.\n\n#### Acceptable Responses\n- “All staff receive incident response training during onboarding, and we conduct annual refresher sessions. Attendance logs are attached.”\n- “We send an annual email to all employees with a summary of the incident response plan and reporting instructions. Sample email and distribution list attached.”\n- “The incident response plan is posted on our staff intranet, and all employees are required to acknowledge reading it. Screenshot and acknowledgement records provided.”\n\n#### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We have an incident response plan and staff can ask IT if they have questions.”\n- “Only IT staff are aware of the plan.”\n- “We told everyone about it last year, but have no records.”\n- “The plan is available if someone wants to read it.”\n\n#### Follow-up Questions\n- How do you ensure new employees are made aware of the plan?\n- When was the last time staff were reminded or trained on the incident response plan?\n- Can you provide evidence that all relevant staff have received this information?\n- How do you verify that staff understand their responsibilities in an incident?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal methods (e.g., documented team meetings, group emails) may be acceptable if all staff are covered and evidence is provided.\n- For larger organizations, more formal processes (e.g., training logs, HR onboarding checklists) are expected.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means using practical, low-cost methods (e.g., email, short briefings) but must be documented.\n- One-off communications are acceptable if all staff are covered and evidence is recent.\n\n### Industry Context\n- Sectors with high staff turnover (e.g., retail, F&B) should show how new joiners are made aware.\n- Organizations with remote or shift workers should demonstrate inclusive communication methods.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Assuming policy existence equals awareness.\n- Only informing IT or management, not all staff with IT access.\n- No ongoing process for new joiners or refresher communications.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Lack of dated evidence.\n- No proof of communication to all relevant staff.\n- Evidence only covers a subset of employees.\n\n### False Positives\n- Policy documents presented as evidence of awareness without proof of communication.\n- Generic statements with no supporting documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Did the organization provide evidence that ALL employees with IT access are made aware of the incident response plan?**\n   - **No** → FAIL\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n2. **Is the evidence recent (within 12 months) and does it cover all relevant staff?**\n   - **No** → Partial Compliance or FAIL (seek clarification)\n   - **Yes** → Proceed\n\n3. **Is there a defined, repeatable process for ensuring ongoing awareness (e.g., onboarding, annual reminders)?**\n   - **No** → Partial Compliance (recommend improvement)\n   - **Yes** → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or only partially covers staff, request additional documentation or clarification.\n- If there are signs of fabricated or inconsistent evidence, escalate to a senior auditor.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n- Use follow-up questions to clarify ambiguous responses before making a final decision.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAuditors should look for clear, recent, and comprehensive evidence that all employees with IT access are made aware of the incident response plan, using practical and proportionate methods. Lack of evidence, limited coverage, or outdated communications should result in a FAIL or request for further information.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nThe organization must perform a review after any cybersecurity incident (even minor ones), identify what happened, what worked, what failed, and what can be improved. The organization must then update its incident response plan or related processes based on these lessons learned.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure continuous improvement of incident response capabilities  \n- Prevent recurrence of similar incidents  \n- Foster a culture of learning and adaptation\n\n**Why This Is Important:**  \nWithout post-incident reviews, organizations risk repeating mistakes, missing opportunities to strengthen defenses, and failing to adapt to evolving threats. This provision ensures that even small organizations learn from incidents and improve over time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization describes a process for conducting post-incident reviews after cybersecurity incidents.\n- There is evidence that at least one post-incident review has been conducted (if any incidents have occurred).\n- The organization can show that learning points or recommendations from the review have been incorporated into updates or improvements to the incident response plan or related procedures.\n- The process is proportionate to the organization’s size and resources (e.g., a simple meeting and documented notes for small organizations).\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No process for post-incident review is described.\n- No evidence of any post-incident review, despite incidents having occurred.\n- No indication that lessons learned are used to update or improve the incident response plan.\n- The response is purely theoretical or generic, with no evidence of actual implementation.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The organization describes a review process but cannot provide evidence of it being conducted (e.g., no incidents have occurred yet).\n- The review is conducted, but there is no clear link to updates or improvements in the incident response plan.\n- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- Post-incident review reports, meeting notes, or summary emails\n- Updated incident response plan with tracked changes or version history\n- Action items or recommendations resulting from the review\n- Communications showing dissemination of lessons learned\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence should be dated and specific to actual incidents (not templates or blank forms)\n- Updates to the incident response plan should reference the review or lessons learned\n- For small organizations, informal documentation (e.g., email summaries, meeting notes) is acceptable if it clearly shows the review and resulting actions\n\n### Red Flags\n- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or generic\n- Only policy documents are provided, with no indication of actual use\n- Evidence appears fabricated or retroactively created for the audit\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- Description of a post-incident review process (who is involved, what is reviewed, how often)\n- Evidence of at least one review (if incidents have occurred)\n- Clear link between review findings and updates to the incident response plan\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “After our phishing incident in March, we held a meeting to review what happened. We updated our incident response checklist to include a step for notifying staff and improved our email filtering settings. Meeting notes and the updated plan are attached.”\n- “We have a simple process: after any incident, the IT lead and manager meet to discuss what went wrong and what to improve. Our last review led to a change in password reset procedures. See attached email summary and updated procedure.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We have a policy to review incidents, but we haven’t done any reviews.” (when incidents have occurred)\n- “We will conduct reviews if something happens.” (with no process or evidence)\n- “Our incident response plan is sufficient and does not need updating.”\n- Only providing a blank template or policy document with no evidence of use\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide an example of a post-incident review you conducted?”\n- “How did you update your incident response plan based on the review?”\n- “If no incidents have occurred, how would you conduct a review if one did?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, informal reviews (e.g., a short meeting and email summary) are acceptable.\n- The process does not need to be complex or formal, but must be documented.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- “Reasonable effort” means a simple, repeatable process that fits the organization’s size and capacity.\n- Evidence can be minimal but must be real and show actual learning and improvement.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For sectors with regulatory requirements, more formal documentation may be expected.\n- For non-regulated, small businesses, informal but clear documentation is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- Organizations claim to have a process but cannot show any evidence of actual reviews.\n- Reviews are conducted but not documented.\n- Lessons learned are not incorporated into updated plans.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Only templates or policies are provided, not actual review records.\n- Evidence is outdated or unrelated to cybersecurity incidents.\n\n### False Positives\n- Responses that describe a process but have no evidence of it being followed.\n- Updates to plans that are not clearly linked to incident reviews.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Has the organization described a post-incident review process?**\n   - If NO → FAIL\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n2. **Has the organization provided evidence of at least one review (if incidents have occurred)?**\n   - If NO (and incidents have occurred) → FAIL\n   - If NO (and no incidents have occurred) → PARTIAL (seek clarification)\n   - If YES → proceed\n\n3. **Is there evidence that lessons learned have been incorporated into updates to the incident response plan or procedures?**\n   - If NO → PARTIAL (seek clarification)\n   - If YES → PASS\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.\n- If the organization claims no incidents have occurred, verify plausibility based on organization size and sector.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across similar organizations.\n- Allow for proportionality based on size, but require real, documented learning and improvement.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must show a real, documented process for post-incident review and demonstrate that lessons learned are used to improve their incident response plan. Accept informal documentation for small organizations, but require evidence of actual implementation, not just intent or policy.",

Provision Overview\n\n**What the Provision Requires:**  \nOrganizations must review their incident response plan (IRP) at least once every 12 months. This review should ensure the plan remains current, effective, and relevant to the organization’s operations, risks, and IT environment.\n\n**Key Security Objectives:**  \n- Ensure the IRP reflects current threats, business processes, and contact information.\n- Confirm that staff know their roles and responsibilities during an incident.\n- Identify and address gaps or outdated procedures in the plan.\n\n**Context & Importance:**  \nRegular review of the IRP is critical to ensure the organization can respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents. As threats and organizational structures change, an outdated plan can lead to confusion, delays, or ineffective responses, increasing the risk of business disruption or data loss.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluation Framework\n\n### PASS Criteria\n- The organization provides clear evidence that the IRP has been reviewed within the past 12 months.\n- The review is documented (e.g., meeting minutes, review log, updated plan with revision date).\n- The review process is described, even if simple (e.g., checklist, discussion at staff meeting).\n- The organization can identify who was involved in the review.\n\n### FAIL Criteria\n- No evidence of an IRP review within the last 12 months.\n- The IRP exists but has not been reviewed or updated in over a year.\n- The organization cannot describe or demonstrate any review process.\n- The review is claimed but not documented in any way.\n\n### Partial Compliance\n- The IRP was reviewed, but evidence is ambiguous (e.g., undated notes, verbal claims only).\n- The review occurred slightly outside the 12-month window (e.g., 13-14 months ago).\n- The review was superficial (e.g., only a signature, no indication of actual review).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines\n\n### Required Evidence Types\n- IRP document with a revision/review date.\n- Meeting minutes or emails referencing the review.\n- Change log or version history showing annual updates.\n- Staff communications confirming review (e.g., email to team).\n\n### Evidence Quality Standards\n- Evidence must be dated and clearly linked to the IRP review.\n- Evidence should show some level of engagement (not just a date change).\n- Accept simple documentation for small organizations (e.g., a signed/dated cover page).\n\n### Red Flags\n- IRP with no date or version history.\n- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or generic.\n- Review is claimed but no supporting documentation is provided.\n- Evidence appears fabricated (e.g., identical content with only the date changed).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions\n\n### What to Look For\n- A clear statement that the IRP is reviewed at least annually.\n- Supporting evidence showing the last review date within the past 12 months.\n- Description of who conducted the review and what was checked.\n\n### Acceptable Responses\n- “Our IRP was reviewed on [date within last 12 months]. See attached meeting minutes and updated plan.”\n- “We review the IRP every January during our annual IT meeting. Attached is the signed checklist from the last review.”\n- “The IRP was updated on [date], as shown in the document’s version history.”\n\n### Unacceptable Responses\n- “We have an IRP, but we haven’t reviewed it recently.”\n- “We review it when needed, but there’s no record.”\n- “We don’t have a formal review process.”\n- “The IRP was last reviewed over a year ago.”\n\n### Follow-up Questions\n- “Can you provide documentation or evidence of the last IRP review?”\n- “Who was involved in the review, and what changes (if any) were made?”\n- “How do you ensure the IRP remains up to date?”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Considerations\n\n### Organization Size Scaling\n- For very small organizations, a simple signed and dated note or email confirming the review is acceptable.\n- The review process can be informal but must be documented.\n\n### Resource Constraints\n- Accept minimal but clear evidence (e.g., a one-page checklist or email).\n- Do not require formal meeting minutes or complex documentation for micro-businesses.\n\n### Industry Context\n- For regulated sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance), expect more formal review processes.\n- For non-regulated, small businesses, informal but documented reviews are sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls\n\n### Typical Compliance Gaps\n- IRP exists but is never reviewed or updated.\n- Reviews are claimed but not documented.\n- Reviews are performed ad hoc, not annually.\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Missing or undated evidence.\n- Evidence not clearly linked to the IRP review.\n- Only the IRP document is provided, with no indication of review.\n\n### False Positives\n- IRP document has a recent date but no evidence of actual review.\n- “We always keep it up to date” without proof.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scoring Guidance\n\n### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree\n\n1. **Is there evidence the IRP was reviewed within the last 12 months?**\n   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.\n   - **No:** FAIL.\n\n2. **Is the evidence dated and clearly linked to the IRP review?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance – request clarification or additional evidence.\n\n3. **Is the review process described and appropriate for the organization’s size?**\n   - **Yes:** PASS.\n   - **No:** Partial Compliance – request more detail.\n\n### Escalation Criteria\n- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.\n- If the review is just outside the 12-month window, seek guidance on proportionality.\n\n### Consistency Standards\n- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.\n- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo PASS, the organization must provide clear, dated evidence that their incident response plan was reviewed within the last 12 months, with documentation appropriate to their size and resources. Lack of evidence, outdated reviews, or superficial claims without proof should result in a FAIL or request for further clarification.",
