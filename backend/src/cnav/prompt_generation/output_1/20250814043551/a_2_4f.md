            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must review their hardware and software asset inventory at least twice per year (bi-annually) as a good practice. This means there should be a formal or informal process to check, update, and verify the list of all IT assets (hardware and software) at least every six months.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure the organization is aware of all devices and software in use.
- Identify unauthorized or outdated assets that may introduce vulnerabilities.
- Maintain an up-to-date inventory to support patching, incident response, and risk management.

**Context & Importance:**  
Regular inventory reviews help organizations detect “shadow IT,” unauthorized installations, and obsolete systems that could be exploited. For resource-constrained organizations, this is a foundational step to maintain visibility and control over their IT environment.

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization confirms that hardware and software inventories are reviewed at least twice per year.
- There is evidence (e.g., review logs, meeting notes, updated inventory lists with timestamps) showing two or more reviews in the past 12 months.
- The process is repeatable and not ad hoc (i.e., not a one-off or only in response to an incident).

### **FAIL Criteria**
- The organization cannot demonstrate that reviews occur at least twice per year.
- No evidence of reviews, or only a single review in the past 12 months.
- Reviews are only conducted in response to incidents or audits, not as a routine process.

### **Partial Compliance**
- The organization claims to review inventories but only does so annually or on an irregular basis.
- Evidence is ambiguous (e.g., undated inventory lists, unclear review frequency).
- The process is informal and lacks documentation but may be sufficient for very small organizations if verbally described and plausible.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Inventory review logs or checklists with dates.
- Meeting minutes or emails referencing inventory reviews.
- Versioned inventory lists showing updates at least twice in the past year.
- Screenshots of asset management tools with review timestamps.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence should clearly show review dates and responsible personnel.
- Documentation should cover both hardware and software assets.
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).

### **Red Flags**
- Inventory lists with no modification or review dates.
- Evidence only covers hardware or only software, not both.
- Fabricated or backdated evidence (e.g., all reviews appear to have been done on the same day).
- Vague statements without supporting documentation.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Explicit confirmation of bi-annual (twice per year) reviews.
- Dates of the last two reviews.
- Evidence that reviews are part of a routine process.

### **Acceptable Responses**
- “We review our hardware and software inventory every January and July. Attached are the review logs for the past two cycles.”
- “Our IT lead updates the asset list in March and September each year. See attached inventory files with timestamps.”
- For very small organizations: “We only have three computers and one software package. The owner checks the list every six months, as shown in these calendar reminders.”

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “We review our inventory when we remember to.”
- “We last reviewed our inventory in March last year, but not since.”
- “We don’t keep a formal inventory, but we know what we have.”
- “We only check our inventory when there’s a problem.”

### **Follow-up Questions**
- “Can you provide evidence of the last two inventory reviews?”
- “How do you document or track these reviews?”
- “Who is responsible for conducting the reviews?”
- “Does your review cover both hardware and software assets?”

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For micro or very small organizations (e.g., <5 staff), informal processes may be acceptable if they are plausible and consistently applied (e.g., owner’s calendar reminders, simple checklists).
- Larger organizations should have more formal documentation and clear assignment of responsibility.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Accept simple, low-tech solutions (e.g., Excel sheets, paper checklists) if they are used consistently.
- Do not require enterprise-grade asset management tools.

### **Industry Context**
- Organizations with highly dynamic IT environments (e.g., tech startups) may need more frequent reviews.
- Static environments (e.g., small retail shops) may have little change, but reviews must still occur at least twice per year.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Only annual reviews, or reviews done less frequently than required.
- No evidence of review dates or responsible persons.
- Inventory only covers hardware or only software.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Inventory lists with no timestamps or version history.
- Evidence provided is outdated (older than 12 months).

### **False Positives**
- Organization claims compliance but cannot produce evidence.
- Inventory list is updated, but no record of review process or frequency.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Does the organization claim to review inventories at least twice per year?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed
2. **Is there credible evidence of at least two reviews in the past 12 months?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → PASS
3. **Is the evidence recent, covers both hardware and software, and shows a repeatable process?**
   - If YES → PASS
   - If only partially (e.g., informal but plausible for very small orgs) → consider Partial Compliance
   - If NO → FAIL

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization is very small and uses informal processes, but the approach is plausible and consistent, document rationale for acceptance.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards for evidence and review frequency across similar organizations.
- Document any deviations from standard criteria with justification (e.g., micro-organization with minimal assets).

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and credible evidence that hardware and software inventories are reviewed at least twice per year. Accept simple, resource-appropriate processes for small organizations, but require that the process is repeatable and covers all relevant assets. Inadequate, infrequent, or undocumented reviews should result in a FAIL. Escalate ambiguous or suspicious cases for further review.
