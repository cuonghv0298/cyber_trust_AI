# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.1.4c  
**Clause: Assets: People – Equip employees with know-how to be the first line of defence**  
**Provision Requirement:** Cyber hygiene practices and guidelines must cover:  
- Phishing protection  
- Strong passphrase setting and protection  
- Device protection (corporate/personal used for work)  
- Incident reporting  
- Careful handling/disclosure of business-critical data  
- Secure onsite and remote work

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that all employees are provided with clear, practical guidance or training on key cyber hygiene topics. This includes not just having policies, but actively equipping staff with the knowledge to recognize and respond to common cyber threats, especially those exploiting human error.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Reduce risk of successful phishing and social engineering attacks  
- Prevent unauthorized access via weak or mishandled passwords  
- Safeguard devices used for work, whether corporate or personal  
- Ensure prompt reporting of incidents for rapid response  
- Protect sensitive business data from accidental or intentional leaks  
- Maintain security standards regardless of work location

**Context/Importance:**  
Human error is a leading cause of cybersecurity incidents. Basic awareness and practical guidance empower employees to act as a security asset rather than a liability, especially in resource-constrained environments.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- **Coverage:** Training or guidelines explicitly address **all six required topics**.
- **Accessibility:** Guidance is available to all relevant employees (not just IT staff).
- **Recency:** Training/guidelines are current (within the last 12 months or clearly reviewed/updated).
- **Format:** Can be formal (e.g., slides, handouts, e-learning) or informal (e.g., staff briefings, posters), but must be documented.

### FAIL Criteria
- **Omission:** One or more required topics are missing from training/guidelines.
- **Irrelevance:** Topics are generic or unrelated to the organization's actual work context.
- **Inaccessibility:** No evidence that employees have access to the guidance.
- **Obsolescence:** Guidance is outdated (e.g., references obsolete threats or tools).

### Partial Compliance
- **Partial Coverage:** Some, but not all, topics are covered.
- **Draft/Planned:** Guidance exists but is not yet implemented or disseminated.
- **Unclear Evidence:** Evidence is ambiguous or lacks detail on topic coverage.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Training materials (slides, handouts, e-learning screenshots)
- Staff communications (emails, memos, posters)
- Employee handbook or onboarding guides
- Attendance records or sign-in sheets (if available)
- Policy documents referencing the six topics

### Evidence Quality Standards
- **Specificity:** Materials must clearly reference each required topic.
- **Clarity:** Guidance is understandable to non-technical staff.
- **Recency:** Dated within the last 12 months or with evidence of regular review.
- **Distribution:** Evidence that materials are shared with all relevant staff.

### Red Flags
- Vague statements (“We tell staff to be careful online”) without supporting materials
- Outdated materials (e.g., undated, referencing old threats)
- Evidence only covers IT staff, not all employees
- Fabricated or generic templates with no organization-specific adaptation

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Self-Assessment Question:  
**HR: Are the training topics covering phishing, password management, etc.? Share the topics or training guides.**

#### What to Look For
- A list or summary of training topics that **explicitly** mentions all six required areas.
- Attached or referenced training materials/guides.
- Evidence that these materials are distributed to all employees.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “Our annual cyber hygiene training covers: phishing awareness, setting and protecting strong passwords, securing work devices (including BYOD), incident reporting procedures, handling business-critical data, and secure practices for both office and remote work. See attached slides and staff memo.”
- “We provide a one-page guide to all staff covering these six topics, updated every year. Attached is the latest version.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “We tell staff to be careful with emails and passwords.” (No evidence or incomplete topic coverage)
- “Only IT staff receive security training.” (Not organization-wide)
- “We have a policy, but it’s not shared with employees.” (No dissemination)
- “Training covers phishing and passwords, but not device protection or incident reporting.” (Missing topics)

#### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide the actual training materials or guides?”
- “How do you ensure all employees receive this guidance?”
- “When was the last time the materials were updated or reviewed?”
- “Are personal devices used for work included in the guidance?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal briefings or a simple one-page guide are acceptable if all six topics are covered and shared with all staff.

### Resource Constraints
- Materials do not need to be professionally produced; clarity and coverage are more important than polish.
- Free or government-provided templates are acceptable if adapted to the organization’s context.

### Industry Context
- For sectors with unique risks (e.g., healthcare, finance), ensure guidance addresses sector-specific data handling or remote work scenarios.
- For organizations with no remote work, “secure remote work” guidance can be brief but should state the policy.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Missing one or more required topics (especially incident reporting or secure remote work)
- Only IT or management staff receive training
- Outdated or generic materials not tailored to the organization

### Documentation Issues
- No evidence of dissemination to staff
- Materials are undated or lack version control

### False Positives
- Responses that list topics but provide no supporting materials
- Overly generic statements with no evidence of actual implementation

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Are all six required topics covered in the training/guidance?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Continue

2. **Is there evidence that the guidance is current and distributed to all staff?**
   - **No:** FAIL or Partial Compliance (request more evidence)
   - **Yes:** Continue

3. **Is the evidence specific, clear, and organization-appropriate?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance (request clarification)
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers the topics, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization disputes topic relevance or if evidence authenticity is in doubt.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same topic coverage and evidence standards to all organizations, adjusting only for size and sector as outlined above.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must provide evidence that all employees receive clear, current guidance or training covering all six specified cyber hygiene topics. Evidence must be specific, accessible, and appropriate for the organization’s size and context. Incomplete, outdated, or generic responses should result in FAIL or require further investigation.
