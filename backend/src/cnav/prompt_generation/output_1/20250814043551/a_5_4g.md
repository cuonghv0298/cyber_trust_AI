            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.5.4g  
**Clause**: Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s data and services  
**Provision**: Access shall be managed to ensure that third parties or contractors can access only the information and systems required for their job role. Such access shall be removed once they no longer require them.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that any third-party or contractor (e.g., vendors, outsourced IT, consultants) is only granted access to the specific information and systems necessary for their work. This access must be revoked promptly when it is no longer needed (e.g., upon contract completion or project end).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized or excessive access by external parties.
- Minimize risk of data leakage, misuse, or compromise from third parties.
- Ensure timely removal of access to reduce attack surface.

**Context & Importance:**  
Third parties are a common source of breaches due to over-permissive or lingering access. This provision ensures that organizations maintain control over who can access sensitive data and systems, and that such access is strictly limited and temporary.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a clear process for granting third-party/contractor access based on job requirements (principle of least privilege).
- There is a documented or described method for removing access promptly when no longer needed.
- Evidence shows that access is reviewed and removed in a timely manner.
- The organization can provide at least one example of access being granted and later removed for a third party or contractor.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process exists for limiting or removing third-party/contractor access.
- Access is granted broadly or indefinitely without review.
- The organization cannot demonstrate any instance of access removal.
- Responses are vague, generic, or indicate “full access” is given to all third parties.

### Partial Compliance
- The process is informal or ad hoc, but some evidence of access limitation and removal exists.
- Access is limited, but removal is not timely or is inconsistently applied.
- The organization is aware of the need but lacks documentation or consistent practice.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Access request/approval forms or emails for third parties/contractors.
- Screenshots or logs showing user account creation and deactivation.
- Written procedures or policies (even if brief) describing access management for third parties.
- Example list of current or past third-party accounts and their status.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Documentation should be specific to third-party/contractor access, not just general access control.
- Screenshots/logs should clearly show user/account names and access removal actions.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not specific to third parties.
- No proof of access removal (e.g., only access granting is shown).
- Policies are copied from templates with no organization-specific details.
- Evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent with described practices.

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question:  
**Is third-party or contractor access limited to required information and systems, and removed when no longer needed?**

#### What to Look For
- Description of how access is requested, approved, and provisioned for third parties.
- Explanation of how access is restricted to only necessary systems/data.
- Steps taken to remove access when the engagement ends.
- Examples or records of access removal.

#### Acceptable Responses
- “We create separate accounts for each contractor, limited to the project folder and relevant application. When the contract ends, we disable their account within 24 hours. For example, Vendor X’s account was disabled after project Y ended.”
- “Third-party access is approved by the IT manager and limited to the required server. Access is removed immediately after the work is completed, as shown in the attached access log.”
- “We maintain a spreadsheet of all third-party accounts and review it monthly to ensure only active contractors have access.”

#### Unacceptable Responses
- “All contractors use the same admin account as staff.”
- “We don’t track when contractors leave, so access is not removed.”
- “Third parties have access to everything because it’s easier.”
- “No third parties have access” (if evidence or business context suggests otherwise).

#### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide an example of a third-party account that was removed in the last 12 months?
- How do you ensure that access is limited to only what is needed?
- Who is responsible for removing third-party access, and how is this tracked?
- How quickly is access removed after it is no longer needed?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, informal processes (e.g., email approvals, manual account disabling) are acceptable if consistently applied and evidenced.
- A simple spreadsheet or checklist is sufficient for tracking access if formal systems are not in place.

### Resource Constraints
- Written procedures can be brief and practical; formal policies are not required.
- Manual processes are acceptable if they are consistently followed and evidenced.

### Industry Context
- Organizations in regulated sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare) may require stricter controls.
- For organizations with no third-party access, ensure this is justified by business context and not used to avoid compliance.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Failing to remove access after contract/project completion.
- Granting excessive or blanket access to all third parties.
- No tracking or review of third-party accounts.

### Documentation Issues
- Lack of evidence for access removal.
- Policies that are not implemented in practice.
- Evidence that does not distinguish between staff and third-party access.

### False Positives
- Descriptions of access control without any supporting evidence.
- “We trust our contractors” as justification for not limiting access.

---

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the organization have a process (formal or informal) for limiting third-party/contractor access to only what is required?**
   - If YES, proceed.
   - If NO, FAIL.

2. **Is there evidence that access is removed when no longer needed?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, FAIL.

3. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and credible?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, request clarification or additional evidence.

4. **If the process is informal but consistently applied and evidenced, is it proportionate to organization size?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or inconsistent, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims no third-party access, but business context suggests otherwise, seek clarification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical evidence that third-party/contractor access is both limited and removed when no longer needed. Accept informal but consistent processes for small organizations, but require specific, recent evidence of both access limitation and removal. Reject vague, generic, or unevidenced claims. Escalate unclear cases and ensure consistent application of criteria across all assessments.
