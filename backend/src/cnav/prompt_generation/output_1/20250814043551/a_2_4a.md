# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4a  
**Clause: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them**  
**Provision Requirement:** An up-to-date asset inventory of all the hardware and software assets shall be maintained in the organisation. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., use of spreadsheet or IT asset management software to maintain the IT asset inventory.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
- The organization must maintain a current and accurate inventory of all hardware and software assets.  
- The inventory can be managed using simple tools (e.g., spreadsheets) or more advanced IT asset management solutions, depending on the organization's size and resources.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure the organization is aware of all devices and software in use, reducing the risk of unmanaged or unknown assets being exploited.
- Enable effective patching, configuration, and incident response by knowing what assets exist.

**Context and Importance:**  
- Untracked devices or software can become entry points for attackers.
- Maintaining an asset inventory is foundational for all other security controls (e.g., updates, backups, incident response).

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization provides evidence of a maintained asset inventory covering both hardware and software.
- The inventory is up-to-date (reviewed/updated within the last 6 months).
- The inventory includes sufficient detail (e.g., device type, owner/user, operating system, software versions).
- There is a clear process or responsible person/team for updating the inventory.

### FAIL Criteria
- No asset inventory is provided, or the inventory is clearly outdated (not updated in the last 12 months).
- The inventory is incomplete (e.g., only hardware or only software is listed).
- The inventory lacks essential details (e.g., only device names, no software information).
- The organization is unaware of how asset information is collected or maintained.

### Partial Compliance
- The inventory exists but is missing minor details or is slightly out of date (e.g., last updated 7-12 months ago).
- The inventory covers most, but not all, assets (e.g., servers and laptops but not mobile devices).
- The process for updating the inventory is informal or ad hoc.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Asset inventory file (spreadsheet, database export, screenshot of asset management tool).
- Documentation or description of the process for updating the inventory.
- Evidence of recent review or update (e.g., file metadata, change log, email notification).

### Evidence Quality Standards
- The inventory should be readable, organized, and cover both hardware and software.
- Evidence should show recent activity or updates.
- The process for maintaining the inventory should be described and appear practical for the organization’s size.

### Red Flags
- Inventory files with old timestamps or no indication of recent updates.
- Inventories that list only a few devices/software for a larger organization.
- Vague or generic process descriptions (e.g., “IT handles it” with no further detail).
- Evidence that appears fabricated (e.g., template files with no real data).

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Q1: What operating system is used for end-user devices and applications currently?
**What to Look For:**  
- The response should reference the asset inventory as the source of this information.
- The answer should be consistent with the inventory provided (e.g., if Windows 10 is listed, it should appear in the inventory).

**Acceptable Responses:**  
- “We use Windows 10 and macOS for end-user devices, as listed in our asset inventory (see attached spreadsheet).”
- “Our inventory (attached) shows all operating systems in use, including version numbers.”

**Unacceptable Responses:**  
- “Not sure” or “We think it’s mostly Windows.”
- No reference to an inventory or supporting evidence.

**Follow-up Questions:**  
- “How do you ensure this information stays up to date?”
- “Who is responsible for updating the inventory when new devices or software are added?”

---

### Q2: Are there any machines running that you might not be aware of? Who provides that information?
**What to Look For:**  
- The organization should demonstrate awareness of the risk of unknown assets.
- There should be a process or responsible person for identifying and reporting new or unknown devices.

**Acceptable Responses:**  
- “We conduct quarterly checks to ensure all devices are accounted for. The IT manager updates the inventory.”
- “Staff are required to inform IT of any new devices. The inventory is reviewed monthly.”

**Unacceptable Responses:**  
- “We don’t know if there are unknown machines.”
- “No one is responsible for this.”

**Follow-up Questions:**  
- “How do you detect unauthorized or unknown devices?”
- “When was the last time the inventory was updated?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple spreadsheet listing all devices and software is acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect more structured inventories and clearer update processes.

### Resource Constraints
- Manual inventories are acceptable if they are kept up to date.
- Automated tools are not required but may be used if available.

### Industry Context
- Organizations with high staff turnover or frequent device changes should have more frequent inventory updates.
- Sectors with regulatory requirements may need more detailed inventories.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Inventory only lists hardware, not software.
- Inventory is created once and never updated.
- No clear responsibility for maintaining the inventory.

### Documentation Issues
- Inventory files are missing, incomplete, or not provided.
- Evidence is outdated or inconsistent with responses.

### False Positives
- Inventory appears comprehensive but is not updated regularly.
- Responses claim compliance but cannot provide supporting evidence.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is an asset inventory provided?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Continue

2. **Does the inventory cover both hardware and software?**
   - **No:** FAIL
   - **Yes:** Continue

3. **Is the inventory up-to-date (reviewed/updated within 6 months)?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on how outdated)
   - **Yes:** Continue

4. **Is there a clear process or responsible person for maintaining the inventory?**
   - **No:** Partial Compliance
   - **Yes:** PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If the inventory is incomplete or outdated but the organization demonstrates intent and a plan to improve, escalate for senior auditor review.
- If evidence appears fabricated or inconsistent, request additional evidence or clarification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for inventory completeness and update frequency across similar organizations.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, up-to-date, and complete asset inventories (hardware and software), supported by evidence and a defined maintenance process. Responses must be practical for the organization’s size but must demonstrate real, ongoing asset management. Incomplete, outdated, or unsupported claims should result in FAIL or further investigation.
