# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.9.4c  
**Clause:** Respond: Incident response – Be ready to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents  
**Provision:** The organisation should conduct post-incident review and incorporate learning points to strengthen and improve the incident response plan.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must perform a review after any cybersecurity incident (even minor ones), identify what happened, what worked, what failed, and what can be improved. The organization must then update its incident response plan or related processes based on these lessons learned.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Ensure continuous improvement of incident response capabilities  
- Prevent recurrence of similar incidents  
- Foster a culture of learning and adaptation

**Why This Is Important:**  
Without post-incident reviews, organizations risk repeating mistakes, missing opportunities to strengthen defenses, and failing to adapt to evolving threats. This provision ensures that even small organizations learn from incidents and improve over time.

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization describes a process for conducting post-incident reviews after cybersecurity incidents.
- There is evidence that at least one post-incident review has been conducted (if any incidents have occurred).
- The organization can show that learning points or recommendations from the review have been incorporated into updates or improvements to the incident response plan or related procedures.
- The process is proportionate to the organization’s size and resources (e.g., a simple meeting and documented notes for small organizations).

### FAIL Criteria
- No process for post-incident review is described.
- No evidence of any post-incident review, despite incidents having occurred.
- No indication that lessons learned are used to update or improve the incident response plan.
- The response is purely theoretical or generic, with no evidence of actual implementation.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization describes a review process but cannot provide evidence of it being conducted (e.g., no incidents have occurred yet).
- The review is conducted, but there is no clear link to updates or improvements in the incident response plan.
- Evidence is incomplete or unclear; further clarification is needed.

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Post-incident review reports, meeting notes, or summary emails
- Updated incident response plan with tracked changes or version history
- Action items or recommendations resulting from the review
- Communications showing dissemination of lessons learned

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be dated and specific to actual incidents (not templates or blank forms)
- Updates to the incident response plan should reference the review or lessons learned
- For small organizations, informal documentation (e.g., email summaries, meeting notes) is acceptable if it clearly shows the review and resulting actions

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated, unsigned, or generic
- Only policy documents are provided, with no indication of actual use
- Evidence appears fabricated or retroactively created for the audit

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Description of a post-incident review process (who is involved, what is reviewed, how often)
- Evidence of at least one review (if incidents have occurred)
- Clear link between review findings and updates to the incident response plan

### Acceptable Responses
- “After our phishing incident in March, we held a meeting to review what happened. We updated our incident response checklist to include a step for notifying staff and improved our email filtering settings. Meeting notes and the updated plan are attached.”
- “We have a simple process: after any incident, the IT lead and manager meet to discuss what went wrong and what to improve. Our last review led to a change in password reset procedures. See attached email summary and updated procedure.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We have a policy to review incidents, but we haven’t done any reviews.” (when incidents have occurred)
- “We will conduct reviews if something happens.” (with no process or evidence)
- “Our incident response plan is sufficient and does not need updating.”
- Only providing a blank template or policy document with no evidence of use

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide an example of a post-incident review you conducted?”
- “How did you update your incident response plan based on the review?”
- “If no incidents have occurred, how would you conduct a review if one did?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, informal reviews (e.g., a short meeting and email summary) are acceptable.
- The process does not need to be complex or formal, but must be documented.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means a simple, repeatable process that fits the organization’s size and capacity.
- Evidence can be minimal but must be real and show actual learning and improvement.

### Industry Context
- For sectors with regulatory requirements, more formal documentation may be expected.
- For non-regulated, small businesses, informal but clear documentation is sufficient.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Organizations claim to have a process but cannot show any evidence of actual reviews.
- Reviews are conducted but not documented.
- Lessons learned are not incorporated into updated plans.

### Documentation Issues
- Only templates or policies are provided, not actual review records.
- Evidence is outdated or unrelated to cybersecurity incidents.

### False Positives
- Responses that describe a process but have no evidence of it being followed.
- Updates to plans that are not clearly linked to incident reviews.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Has the organization described a post-incident review process?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

2. **Has the organization provided evidence of at least one review (if incidents have occurred)?**
   - If NO (and incidents have occurred) → FAIL
   - If NO (and no incidents have occurred) → PARTIAL (seek clarification)
   - If YES → proceed

3. **Is there evidence that lessons learned have been incorporated into updates to the incident response plan or procedures?**
   - If NO → PARTIAL (seek clarification)
   - If YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, incomplete, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims no incidents have occurred, verify plausibility based on organization size and sector.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across similar organizations.
- Allow for proportionality based on size, but require real, documented learning and improvement.

---

**Summary:**  
To PASS, the organization must show a real, documented process for post-incident review and demonstrate that lessons learned are used to improve their incident response plan. Accept informal documentation for small organizations, but require evidence of actual implementation, not just intent or policy.
