# Evaluation Prompt for A.3.4c
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.3.4c

            ## Provision ID
            A.3.4c

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must have a process in place to protect its business-critical data. This includes applying practical security measures such as password-protecting documents, encrypting personal data (especially at rest), and/or securing emails containing sensitive information.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive or business-critical data.
- Reduce the risk of data breaches or leaks, especially for personal or confidential information.
- Ensure that, even if data is lost or stolen, it remains protected and unreadable to unauthorized parties.

**Context and Importance:**  
Data is a prime target for cyberattacks. Many breaches occur due to unprotected files or emails. Simple, practical controls like password protection and encryption are effective, affordable, and essential for organizations with limited resources. This provision ensures that organizations take basic but critical steps to secure their most valuable information.

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization demonstrates that it has identified its business-critical data.
- There is a clear, implemented process for protecting such data (e.g., password protection, encryption at rest, secure email practices).
- The process is applied consistently to all relevant data types.
- Evidence (e.g., screenshots, policy documents, configuration settings) supports the claims.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No process exists, or the process is only informal/verbal with no supporting evidence.
- Critical data is not protected by any means (no password protection, no encryption, no secure email).
- The organization is unaware of what constitutes business-critical data or where it is stored.
- Evidence is missing, irrelevant, or clearly fabricated.

### **Partial Compliance**
- Some, but not all, critical data is protected.
- The process is ad hoc or inconsistently applied.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of data.
- The organization is in the process of implementing controls but has not completed them.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Data protection policy or procedure documents.
- Screenshots showing password protection or encryption settings on files/folders.
- Examples of encrypted emails or secure email settings.
- Lists or inventories of business-critical data and their protection status.
- Training materials or communications to staff about data protection practices.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Should directly relate to the organization’s actual data and systems.
- Screenshots should show real configurations, not generic templates.
- Policies should be specific, not generic or copied from the internet.

### **Red Flags**
- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not organization-specific.
- Screenshots are stock images or do not match the described environment.
- Policies are vague, lack implementation details, or are not followed in practice.
- No evidence provided, or evidence is irrelevant to the provision.

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Clear identification of what data is considered business-critical.
- Description of how such data is protected (e.g., password protection, encryption).
- Evidence that these measures are actually in use (not just planned or theoretical).
- Consistency between the self-assessment answer and the supporting evidence.

### **Acceptable Responses**
- “We maintain a list of business-critical files, which are stored in a password-protected folder on our server. Sensitive documents are encrypted using [tool], and all emails containing personal data are sent using [secure email solution]. See attached screenshots and policy.”
- “All HR and finance documents are encrypted at rest using BitLocker. Staff are trained to password-protect sensitive PDFs before sharing. See attached training slides and screenshots.”

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “We try to keep important files safe.”
- “We don’t have any critical data.”
- “We plan to implement encryption next year.”
- “All our data is in the cloud, so it’s safe.” (without further details)
- No evidence provided, or evidence does not match the described process.

### **Follow-up Questions**
- What types of data do you consider business-critical?
- How do you ensure all such data is protected (e.g., is there a checklist or automated process)?
- Can you provide a recent example of a protected document or encrypted email?
- How do you train staff to apply these measures?

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations, a simple documented process (e.g., a one-page policy and a few screenshots) is acceptable.
- The expectation is not enterprise-grade encryption, but practical, affordable controls (e.g., built-in OS encryption, password-protected files).

### **Resource Constraints**
- Free or built-in tools (e.g., Windows BitLocker, password-protected PDFs, secure email settings) are acceptable.
- Manual processes are acceptable if consistently applied and documented.

### **Industry Context**
- Organizations handling regulated data (e.g., healthcare, finance) may need to show stronger controls.
- For organizations with minimal personal data, the focus should still be on any business-critical information (e.g., client lists, financials).

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Only some data is protected, or protection is inconsistent.
- Staff are unaware of which data needs protection.
- Reliance on cloud provider security without additional controls.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Policies are generic or not tailored to the organization.
- Evidence is outdated or not linked to actual practices.

### **False Positives**
- Descriptions of controls without evidence of actual use.
- Overstating the effectiveness of cloud security without demonstrating configuration.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Is there a documented process for protecting business-critical data?**
   - If NO → FAIL
2. **Is the process implemented and evidenced (e.g., screenshots, policies, examples)?**
   - If NO → FAIL
3. **Is the process applied to all relevant data?**
   - If NO or only partially → Partial Compliance (request clarification or improvement)
4. **Is the evidence current and organization-specific?**
   - If NO → FAIL or Partial Compliance (depending on severity)
5. **If all above are YES → PASS**

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If the organization claims not to have any business-critical data, escalate for review.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards for evidence and process across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical, and consistently applied measures to protect business-critical data, supported by current and organization-specific evidence. Responses must go beyond intent or generic statements and demonstrate real, implemented controls appropriate to the organization’s size and resources.
