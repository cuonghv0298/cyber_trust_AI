# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.4.4g  
**Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Host-based (Software) Firewall Configuration**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
All endpoints (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, servers) that connect to the Internet and/or cloud-based applications must have a software (host-based) firewall configured and switched on, wherever this feature is available. This typically means enabling the built-in firewall in operating systems (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall, macOS Firewall) or using a firewall feature in endpoint security/anti-malware solutions.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized inbound and outbound network connections on endpoints.
- Reduce the risk of malware spreading or attackers gaining access to endpoints.
- Provide a baseline layer of defense, especially for devices outside the organization’s physical perimeter.

**Context & Importance:**  
Host-based firewalls are a critical last line of defense, especially for remote or mobile endpoints. They are easy to enable and require minimal ongoing management, making them a practical and effective control for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization confirms that a software firewall is configured and switched on for **all** endpoints where available.
- The response covers all relevant device types (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).
- There is evidence (e.g., screenshots, policy documents, configuration reports) showing firewalls are enabled.
- If any endpoints do not support a software firewall, a reasonable explanation is provided (e.g., legacy devices, IoT devices), and these are documented as exceptions.

### FAIL Criteria
- The organization cannot confirm that firewalls are enabled on all endpoints.
- The response is vague, incomplete, or only covers some endpoints.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly outdated or irrelevant.
- The organization relies solely on a network firewall and does not address host-based firewalls.

### Partial Compliance
- Firewalls are enabled on most, but not all, endpoints, with some gaps or unclear exceptions.
- The organization is in the process of enabling firewalls but has not completed the rollout.
- Evidence is provided for some, but not all, device types.
- Further clarification or additional evidence is needed to determine compliance.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of firewall settings from representative endpoints (e.g., Windows Security Center, macOS Security & Privacy).
- Device management reports showing firewall status across the fleet.
- Written IT policy or procedure stating that firewalls must be enabled.
- Inventory or list of endpoints with firewall status indicated.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 3 months).
- Screenshots should clearly show the firewall is enabled and, if possible, the device name or user.
- Reports should cover all relevant device types and indicate coverage (e.g., “100% of Windows laptops have firewall enabled”).
- Policies should be dated and reflect current practice.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, not organization-specific, or appears copied from the Internet.
- Screenshots are old, cropped, or do not show relevant details.
- No evidence for certain device types (e.g., only Windows, but organization also uses Macs).
- Policy exists, but no proof of actual implementation.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Explicit confirmation that software firewalls are enabled on all endpoints.
- Mention of all operating systems in use.
- Evidence that matches the organization’s device inventory.
- Any exceptions are clearly listed and justified.

### Acceptable Responses
- “All company laptops and desktops (Windows and Mac) have the built-in firewall enabled. See attached screenshots from both OS types and a device management report showing compliance.”
- “Our IT policy requires firewalls to be enabled on all endpoints. Attached is a screenshot from our endpoint management tool showing 100% compliance.”
- “We have 10 Windows PCs and 2 Macs; all have their respective firewalls enabled. See attached screenshots.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We have a firewall on our network, so we don’t need to enable software firewalls.”
- “We think most computers have it enabled, but we haven’t checked.”
- “No evidence provided.”
- “Only Windows devices have firewalls enabled; Macs are not mentioned.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide evidence for all device types in use?”
- “How do you ensure new devices have the firewall enabled?”
- “Are there any exceptions? If so, please explain and document them.”
- “When was the last time you verified firewall status across all endpoints?”

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 endpoints), manual checks and screenshots are acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect some form of centralized reporting or inventory.

### Resource Constraints
- Built-in OS firewalls are sufficient; no need for advanced or paid solutions.
- Manual processes are acceptable if documented and consistently applied.

### Industry Context
- Some specialized devices (e.g., POS terminals, medical devices) may not support host-based firewalls; these should be documented as exceptions with justification.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming a network firewall is sufficient and ignoring host-based firewalls.
- Overlooking non-Windows devices (e.g., Macs, Linux).
- Not checking or documenting the status on all endpoints.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated screenshots or reports.
- Policies that are not enforced in practice.
- Evidence that does not match the organization’s device inventory.

### False Positives
- Policy exists, but no proof of implementation.
- Evidence from only a subset of devices.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there explicit confirmation that software firewalls are enabled on all endpoints?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Continue

2. **Is there recent, organization-specific evidence for all device types?**
   - **No** → Partial/FAIL (request more evidence)
   - **Yes** → Continue

3. **Are any exceptions documented and justified?**
   - **No** → FAIL (unless all endpoints are covered)
   - **Yes** → Continue

4. **Does the evidence match the organization’s inventory and policy?**
   - **No** → Partial/FAIL
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, escalate to a senior auditor or request additional evidence.
- If the organization claims technical limitations, verify the legitimacy and reasonableness of the exception.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and coverage across all organizations of similar size and device mix.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or exception cases.
