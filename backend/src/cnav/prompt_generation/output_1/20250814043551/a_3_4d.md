# Evaluation Prompt for A.3.4d
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.3.4d

            ## Provision ID
            A.3.4d

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must implement practical measures to prevent employees from leaking confidential and/or sensitive data outside the organization. This includes technical controls (e.g., disabling USB ports, restricting file sharing, blocking cloud storage, email restrictions) and/or procedural controls (e.g., policies, user awareness, monitoring).

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized transfer of sensitive data outside the organization.
- Reduce risk of data loss, theft, or unintentional disclosure by employees.
- Ensure that employees cannot easily bypass controls to exfiltrate data.

**Context & Importance:**  
Data leakage is a common cause of security incidents, often resulting from accidental or deliberate actions by insiders. Simple, practical controls can significantly reduce this risk, especially in organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### **PASS Criteria**
- The organization has implemented at least one effective technical control to prevent data leakage (e.g., USB port disabling, file transfer restrictions, DLP software, email attachment controls).
- OR, if technical controls are not feasible, strong procedural controls are in place (e.g., clear policies, regular staff training, monitoring, and enforcement).
- The measures are appropriate to the organization’s size, resources, and risk profile.
- Evidence supports that controls are active and enforced.

### **FAIL Criteria**
- No measures are in place to prevent data leakage.
- Only informal or verbal instructions are provided, with no technical or procedural enforcement.
- Controls are described but not implemented (e.g., “We plan to disable USB ports”).
- Evidence is missing, outdated, or not credible.

### **Partial Compliance**
- Some controls exist but are incomplete (e.g., USB ports disabled on some but not all devices).
- Reliance solely on user awareness without supporting technical or procedural controls.
- Policies exist but are not communicated or enforced.
- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine adequacy.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### **Required Evidence Types**
- Screenshots of USB port control settings, group policy configurations, or endpoint management dashboards.
- Copies of data handling or acceptable use policies.
- Training records or awareness materials.
- System logs or reports showing enforcement of controls.
- Email or cloud storage restrictions documentation.

### **Evidence Quality Standards**
- Evidence must be current (within the last 12 months).
- Should clearly demonstrate that controls are implemented and active.
- Policies must be formally documented and communicated to staff.
- Technical evidence should show organization-wide application, not just on a single device.

### **Red Flags**
- Evidence is generic, not organization-specific.
- Screenshots or documents are outdated or incomplete.
- Policies are draft or not approved.
- No proof of communication or enforcement.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### **What to Look For**
- Clear description of technical and/or procedural measures to prevent data leakage.
- Evidence that these measures are implemented and enforced.
- Appropriateness of controls for the organization’s context.

### **Acceptable Responses**
- “We have disabled USB ports on all company computers using group policy. See attached screenshot of our endpoint management console.”
- “Employees cannot send emails with attachments to external addresses. Our email system blocks such attempts (see policy and system log excerpt).”
- “We have a data handling policy that prohibits use of personal cloud storage. All staff have signed the policy and received training (see training attendance records).”

### **Unacceptable Responses**
- “We tell staff not to copy data to USB drives, but we don’t enforce it.”
- “We plan to implement controls next quarter.”
- “We trust our employees not to leak data.”
- “No measures are in place, but we have never had an incident.”

### **Follow-up Questions**
- How do you ensure that the controls are applied to all relevant devices/users?
- How often are these controls reviewed or tested?
- Can you provide a sample of the communication or training provided to staff?
- Are there any exceptions to these controls, and how are they managed?

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### **Organization Size Scaling**
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), procedural controls (e.g., signed policies, regular reminders) may be acceptable if technical controls are not feasible, but must be documented and enforced.
- For larger organizations, technical controls are expected unless there is a justified reason.

### **Resource Constraints**
- Free or built-in controls (e.g., Windows group policy, basic email restrictions) are acceptable.
- Expensive DLP solutions are not required, but reasonable effort to use available tools is expected.

### **Industry Context**
- Organizations handling highly sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should have stronger controls.
- For sectors with less sensitive data, proportional controls are acceptable, but some measure must be in place.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### **Typical Compliance Gaps**
- Relying solely on trust or informal instructions.
- Controls applied inconsistently across devices or users.
- Outdated or uncommunicated policies.

### **Documentation Issues**
- Lack of evidence showing actual implementation.
- Policies not signed or acknowledged by staff.
- Screenshots or logs not showing organization-wide coverage.

### **False Positives**
- Descriptions of planned controls without evidence of implementation.
- Policies that exist but are not enforced or communicated.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### **Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree**
1. **Are there documented and enforced technical or procedural controls to prevent data leakage?**
   - If YES, proceed to 2.
   - If NO, FAIL.
2. **Is there credible, current evidence of implementation and enforcement?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, FAIL or PARTIAL (request more evidence).
3. **Are controls appropriate for the organization’s size and risk?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL (depending on severity).

### **Escalation Criteria**
- If controls are partial, inconsistent, or evidence is unclear, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.

### **Consistency Standards**
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and risk profile.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, practical, and enforced measures—technical or procedural—to prevent employee data leakage, supported by credible evidence. Responses relying solely on trust, intention, or incomplete controls should not pass. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but require at least documented and enforced procedural controls. Always request further evidence or clarification if responses are unclear or incomplete.
