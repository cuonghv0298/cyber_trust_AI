            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4l  
**Clause:** Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them  
**Provision:** Before disposing of any hardware asset, the organisation shall ensure that all confidential information have been deleted, e.g., encrypting hard disk before reformatting and overwriting it.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**Practical Requirement:**  
Organizations must ensure that, prior to disposing of any hardware asset (e.g., computers, servers, external drives, mobile devices), all confidential information is securely deleted. This can be achieved through methods such as encrypting the hard disk before reformatting, overwriting data, or using secure wipe tools.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data after hardware leaves the organization’s control.
- Reduce risk of data breaches resulting from improper disposal of IT equipment.

**Context & Importance:**  
Disposing of hardware without securely deleting data exposes organizations to data leakage and potential regulatory violations. This provision ensures that even resource-constrained organizations take basic, effective steps to protect data at end-of-life for hardware assets.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a documented and consistently applied process for securely deleting all confidential information from hardware before disposal.
- The process includes at least one recognized secure deletion method (e.g., disk encryption prior to reformatting, overwriting, use of secure erase tools).
- Staff responsible for hardware disposal are aware of and follow this process.
- Evidence (e.g., policy, procedure, disposal records) supports that the process is in use.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process exists for secure deletion of data prior to hardware disposal.
- The process is ad hoc, informal, or not documented.
- Only basic deletion (e.g., file deletion or standard formatting without encryption/overwriting) is performed.
- No evidence is provided, or evidence is clearly fabricated or irrelevant.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization has a process, but it is inconsistently applied or only covers some hardware types.
- The process relies on less secure methods (e.g., standard formatting) but shows intent to improve.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers recent disposals.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Written policy or procedure describing secure data deletion before hardware disposal.
- Records or logs of recent hardware disposals showing secure deletion steps.
- Screenshots or photos of secure erase tools in use (if available).
- Staff training materials or communications about the process.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12 months) and relevant to the organization’s actual hardware assets.
- Documentation should clearly describe the secure deletion method(s) used.
- Disposal records should indicate which assets were securely wiped and by whom.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is generic, copied from the internet, or not tailored to the organization.
- No mention of encryption, overwriting, or secure erase tools.
- Only “delete files” or “format drive” is referenced.
- No proof of staff awareness or training.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Clear description of the secure deletion process for hardware disposal.
- Mention of specific tools or methods (e.g., BitLocker encryption, DBAN, built-in secure erase).
- Evidence that the process is followed (e.g., disposal logs, screenshots, staff attestations).

### Acceptable Responses
- “Before disposing of laptops, we use [Tool Name] to securely wipe the hard drive, and keep a record in our asset disposal log.”
- “All computers are encrypted with BitLocker. Before disposal, we reformat and overwrite the drive using [Tool/Method].”
- “Our IT policy requires secure deletion before disposal. Attached is our procedure and a recent disposal record.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We just delete files before giving away old computers.”
- “We format the drives, but do not use any special tools.”
- “We don’t have a process for this.”
- “We haven’t disposed of any hardware recently, so we don’t need a process.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide a copy of your secure deletion procedure?”
- “What tool or method do you use to ensure data is unrecoverable?”
- “Who is responsible for carrying out secure deletion?”
- “Can you show a recent example of a hardware disposal record?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple written procedure and basic use of free secure erase tools is acceptable.
- If only a few devices are disposed of per year, evidence can be limited to those instances.

### Resource Constraints
- Free or built-in tools (e.g., Windows BitLocker, macOS Disk Utility, DBAN) are acceptable.
- Manual logs or checklists are sufficient if formal asset management systems are not in place.

### Industry Context
- Organizations handling sensitive personal or financial data may require stricter controls.
- For sectors with regulatory requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance), ensure the process meets minimum legal standards.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Confusing file deletion or formatting with secure deletion.
- No process for mobile devices or external storage.
- Lack of staff awareness or training.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated or generic policies not reflecting current practice.
- No evidence of actual disposals or secure deletion being performed.

### False Positives
- Policies that mention secure deletion but no evidence of implementation.
- Responses that claim “all data is deleted” without describing the method.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a documented process for secure deletion before hardware disposal?**
   - If YES, proceed to 2.
   - If NO, FAIL.

2. **Does the process use recognized secure deletion methods (encryption, overwriting, secure erase tools)?**
   - If YES, proceed to 3.
   - If NO, FAIL.

3. **Is there evidence that the process is followed (e.g., disposal records, staff awareness)?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL or FAIL depending on context.

4. **Is the evidence recent and relevant?**
   - If YES, PASS.
   - If NO, PARTIAL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, incomplete, or inconsistent, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if the organization claims compliance but cannot provide any supporting evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, adjusting only for reasonable differences in size and resources.
- Document rationale for each decision, especially in partial or borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, practical process for secure deletion of data before hardware disposal, evidence that the process is followed, and use of recognized secure deletion methods. Responses lacking these elements should be marked as FAIL, with partial credit only if there is clear intent and partial implementation. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not accept “delete files” or “format only” as sufficient.
