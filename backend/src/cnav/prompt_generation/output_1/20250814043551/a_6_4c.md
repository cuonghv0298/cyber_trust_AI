# Evaluation Prompt for A.6.4c
            ## Clause Information
            **Clause ID**: A.6.4c

            ## Provision ID
            A.6.4c

            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must identify and eliminate insecure configurations and weak protocols in their IT environment. This includes, but is not limited to, replacing outdated or insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP, WEP) with secure alternatives (e.g., HTTPS, WPA2/WPA3). The goal is to ensure that all hardware and software are configured to use secure, up-to-date settings and protocols.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent interception or tampering of data in transit.
- Reduce exposure to common attacks exploiting weak protocols or insecure configurations.
- Ensure baseline protection for network and system communications.

**Context & Importance:**  
Many cyberattacks exploit weak protocols (like HTTP or WEP) or default/insecure settings. Upgrading to secure protocols and configurations is a foundational step in reducing risk, especially for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has identified and replaced all known insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP, WEP) with secure alternatives (e.g., HTTPS, WPA2/WPA3).
- Evidence shows that insecure configurations have been remediated or are in the process of being remediated with a clear, short-term timeline.
- The organization demonstrates awareness of what constitutes insecure protocols/configurations and has a process to address them.

### FAIL Criteria
- Insecure protocols or configurations are still in use with no plan or timeline for remediation.
- The organization is unaware of insecure protocols/configurations in their environment.
- No evidence or only generic statements are provided, with no specifics on what has been replaced or upgraded.

### Partial Compliance
- Some insecure protocols/configurations have been addressed, but others remain without a clear plan or timeline.
- The organization is in the process of upgrading but lacks concrete evidence or timelines.
- The response is vague or incomplete, requiring further clarification.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Screenshots of configuration settings (e.g., Wi-Fi security settings showing WPA2/WPA3 enabled, web server settings showing HTTPS enabled).
- Network diagrams or inventories indicating protocol usage.
- Change logs or records of upgrades (e.g., migration from HTTP to HTTPS).
- Policy documents or internal communications about protocol upgrades.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be recent (within the last 12 months).
- Screenshots or documents must clearly show the relevant settings/protocols.
- Evidence should be specific to the organization’s environment (not generic templates).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated, generic, or not organization-specific.
- Screenshots or documents are incomplete or do not clearly show secure settings.
- No evidence provided, or evidence does not match the self-assessment response.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- Specific mention of insecure protocols/configurations previously in use and what they were replaced with.
- Clear evidence of secure protocols/configurations now in place.
- A process or schedule for identifying and upgrading insecure settings.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We previously used HTTP for our internal web portal but have migrated to HTTPS as of March 2024. See attached screenshot of SSL certificate in use.”
- “Our office Wi-Fi was upgraded from WEP to WPA2 in January 2024. Attached is a screenshot of the router settings.”
- “We have reviewed all network devices and confirmed that only secure protocols (HTTPS, WPA2/WPA3) are enabled. See attached inventory and configuration screenshots.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We use secure settings” with no specifics or evidence.
- “We plan to upgrade in the future” with no timeline or supporting documentation.
- “Not applicable” without justification (e.g., organization does use Wi-Fi or web services but provides no evidence).

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you provide a screenshot or configuration file showing the current protocol in use?
- When was the last review of your network and system configurations for insecure protocols?
- Are there any systems still using insecure protocols? If so, what is the plan and timeline for upgrading them?

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), a simple screenshot of Wi-Fi/router settings and web server configuration may suffice.
- For organizations with no in-house IT, evidence of engagement with an IT vendor or managed service provider to address insecure protocols is acceptable.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means at least reviewing all commonly used systems and upgrading the most critical insecure protocols.
- If legacy systems cannot be upgraded, there must be documented compensating controls or a clear plan for replacement.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may have additional regulatory requirements—ensure at least the Cyber Essentials baseline is met.
- If the organization claims certain protocols are required for legacy compatibility, request justification and risk mitigation measures.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Overlooking guest Wi-Fi networks or internal web applications.
- Assuming default device settings are secure without verification.
- Failing to check all endpoints (e.g., printers, IoT devices).

### Documentation Issues
- Screenshots that do not show relevant settings.
- Evidence that is too old or not tied to the current environment.
- Policies without proof of implementation.

### False Positives
- Statements of intent (“We will upgrade”) without action or evidence.
- Evidence from test environments, not production systems.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the organization provide specific evidence of replacing/upgrading insecure protocols/configurations?**
   - **Yes:** Proceed to 2.
   - **No:** FAIL.

2. **Is the evidence recent, specific, and clearly shows secure settings/protocols in use?**
   - **Yes:** PASS.
   - **No:** Partial Compliance or FAIL (depending on severity).

3. **Are there any remaining insecure protocols/configurations?**
   - **No:** PASS.
   - **Yes:** Is there a documented plan with a short-term timeline?
     - **Yes:** Partial Compliance (follow up for completion).
     - **No:** FAIL.

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If the organization claims exceptions due to legacy systems, escalate for senior auditor review.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same evidence and response standards across all organizations of similar size and complexity.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and specific evidence that insecure protocols and configurations have been replaced or upgraded. Acceptable responses must go beyond generic statements and demonstrate actual implementation. Partial compliance may be accepted if there is a clear, imminent plan for full remediation. Consistency and proportionality should be maintained, considering the organization’s size and resources.
