# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.7.4a  
**Update: Software updates – Update software on devices and systems**

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that critical or important updates—especially security patches—for operating systems and applications are identified and applied as soon as possible. This means there should be a clear, prompt process for patching vulnerabilities, particularly those rated as critical or high-risk.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Minimize the window of exposure to known vulnerabilities.
- Prevent exploitation of unpatched systems by attackers.
- Maintain a secure baseline for all devices and systems.

**Context & Importance:**  
Unpatched software is a leading cause of cyber incidents. Attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities for which patches already exist. Prompt patching is a fundamental, high-impact control that significantly reduces risk, especially for organizations with limited resources.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has a defined process for identifying and applying critical/important updates.
- Critical security patches are applied **within a reasonable timeframe** (e.g., within 14 days of release, or sooner if feasible).
- The process covers both operating systems and key applications.
- Evidence shows recent and regular patching activity.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process or ad-hoc/unstructured approach to patching.
- Critical updates are delayed significantly (e.g., applied more than a month after release) or not applied at all.
- Only some systems are patched, or only non-critical updates are applied.
- No evidence of recent patching.

### Partial Compliance
- Patching is performed, but not consistently within a reasonable timeframe.
- Some systems or applications are regularly patched, but others are neglected.
- The process exists but is not documented or is inconsistently followed.
- Further clarification or evidence is needed to determine compliance.

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Patch management policy or documented process (even if informal).
- Patch logs, update histories, or screenshots showing recent updates.
- System-generated reports from update management tools (if available).
- Manual records or checklists for very small organizations.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence must be **recent** (within the last 3 months).
- Should cover both operating systems and key applications.
- Must demonstrate that critical/important updates are prioritized.

### Red Flags
- Evidence is outdated (older than 3 months).
- Only generic statements, no supporting documentation or screenshots.
- Evidence only covers non-critical updates or a subset of systems.
- Fabricated or inconsistent records (e.g., identical screenshots for different systems).

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### Question: "What is the frequency of patching for software and operating‐system vulnerabilities?"

#### What to Look For
- Specific frequency (e.g., "weekly," "within 14 days of patch release," "immediately for critical patches").
- Mention of how critical/important patches are prioritized.
- Description of the process (manual or automated).
- Evidence that matches the described process.

#### Acceptable Responses
- "We review and apply critical security patches within 7 days of release. Other updates are applied monthly. Evidence: Patch logs from the last 2 months attached."
- "Automatic updates are enabled for all systems. Screenshots of update settings and recent update history provided."
- "We check for updates every week and apply critical patches immediately. Manual checklist attached."

#### Unacceptable Responses
- "We patch when we have time."
- "Updates are applied occasionally."
- "No formal process, but we try to keep systems updated."
- No evidence provided, or evidence is outdated.

#### Follow-up Questions
- "How do you determine which patches are critical or important?"
- "Can you provide recent examples of critical patches applied?"
- "Are all devices and key applications included in your patching process?"
- "How do you ensure remote or offsite devices are updated?"

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple manual process (e.g., a checklist or calendar reminders) is acceptable if it is followed consistently.
- Automated updates (e.g., Windows Update, auto-update for browsers) are acceptable if enabled and monitored.

### Resource Constraints
- "Reasonable effort" means updates are applied promptly, but minor delays (e.g., a few days) are acceptable if justified (e.g., operational constraints).
- Organizations are not expected to have enterprise-grade patch management tools, but must demonstrate awareness and action.

### Industry Context
- If the organization uses specialized or legacy systems, reasonable compensating controls (e.g., network isolation, vendor support) should be described if updates cannot be applied immediately.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Only patching operating systems, neglecting applications (e.g., browsers, office suites).
- Relying solely on user-initiated updates without oversight.
- Assuming auto-update is sufficient without verification.

### Documentation Issues
- Evidence is generic, not organization-specific.
- No proof of recent patching activity.
- Policy exists but is not implemented in practice.

### False Positives
- Responses that mention a process but provide no evidence.
- Screenshots or logs that are not recent or do not show critical updates.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there a defined process for identifying and applying critical/important updates?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Are critical updates applied within a reasonable timeframe (≤14 days)?**
   - **No** → FAIL or Partial Compliance (if some effort is shown)
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is there recent, credible evidence of patching activity?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → PASS

4. **Does the process cover both operating systems and key applications?**
   - **No** → Partial Compliance or FAIL
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is unclear, inconsistent, or only partially meets requirements, request additional documentation or clarification.
- Escalate to a senior auditor if there is doubt about the authenticity of evidence or if compensating controls are claimed for unpatchable systems.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for timeliness and evidence quality across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, prompt, and consistent process for applying critical software updates, supported by recent and credible evidence. The process should be practical for the organization's size and resources, but must not neglect key systems or delay critical patches. Incomplete, outdated, or unsupported responses should result in a FAIL or require further investigation.
