# Evaluation Criteria for Provision A.2.4m  
**Clause**: Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the organisation has and protect them  
**Provision**: The organisation should carry out steps to ensure that the assets are disposed of securely and completely, e.g., destroy the hard disks physically or engage disk shredding services.

---

## 1. Provision Overview

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that when hardware (especially those containing data, such as hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, and other storage media) is no longer needed, it is disposed of in a way that data cannot be recovered. This typically involves physical destruction (e.g., shredding, degaussing, crushing) or using a reputable third-party disposal service that provides secure destruction and certification.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized recovery of sensitive or confidential data from disposed hardware.
- Reduce risk of data breaches due to improper disposal.
- Demonstrate accountability and due diligence in asset lifecycle management.

**Context & Importance:**  
Improper disposal of IT assets is a common source of data leaks. Even small organizations may hold sensitive information (e.g., customer data, business records) on old devices. Secure disposal is a baseline control to prevent data from falling into the wrong hands.

---

## 2. Evaluation Framework

### PASS Criteria
- The organization describes a clear, repeatable process for secure disposal of hardware containing data.
- The process includes physical destruction (e.g., shredding, crushing) or use of a reputable third-party service.
- There is evidence that the process has been followed for at least one recent disposal event (if applicable).
- If no disposals have occurred recently, the organization can describe the intended process and name a vendor or method.

### FAIL Criteria
- No process is described, or the process is inadequate (e.g., simply throwing devices in the trash, donating without wiping/destroying).
- No evidence of secure disposal is provided when disposals have occurred.
- The organization is unaware of the need for secure disposal or has not considered it.

### Partial Compliance
- The organization describes a process but lacks evidence of implementation (e.g., no recent disposals).
- The process is informal or ad hoc, but shows awareness and intent to improve.
- The organization wipes devices but does not physically destroy or use a certified service (borderline—requires further probing).

---

## 3. Evidence Assessment Guidelines

### Required Evidence Types
- Disposal records/logs (even simple spreadsheets or emails).
- Certificates of destruction from third-party vendors.
- Photos of physical destruction (if done in-house).
- Written procedures or policies describing the disposal process.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be recent (within the last 12–24 months, if disposals occurred).
- Certificates should include organization name, date, and details of destroyed assets.
- Photos should clearly show destruction of relevant devices.
- Written procedures should be clear and actionable.

### Red Flags
- Vague statements with no supporting documentation.
- Certificates or photos that appear generic, reused, or unrelated to the organization.
- Descriptions that suggest devices are reused, sold, or donated without secure erasure or destruction.

---

## 4. Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions

### What to Look For
- A clear description of the disposal process for hardware containing data.
- Mention of physical destruction or use of a certified third-party service.
- Evidence that the process has been followed (if disposals have occurred).
- Awareness of the need for secure disposal, even if no disposals have yet occurred.

### Acceptable Responses
- “We use [Vendor Name] for secure disposal and receive certificates of destruction for all hard drives. See attached certificate dated [date].”
- “We physically destroy old hard drives using a hammer and document the process with photos. See attached photos and disposal log.”
- “No disposals have occurred in the last year, but our policy is to use [Vendor Name] for secure shredding. See attached policy document.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We throw old computers in the bin.”
- “We donate old laptops to charity without wiping them.”
- “We don’t have a process for disposal.”
- “We just delete files before disposal.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “Can you provide a sample certificate of destruction or disposal log?”
- “How do you ensure that all data is irrecoverable before donating or disposing of devices?”
- “Who is responsible for overseeing the disposal process?”
- “If you have not disposed of any devices recently, what is your planned process?”

---

## 5. Practical Considerations

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple documented process (e.g., physically destroying drives with a hammer and keeping a photo log) is acceptable.
- Use of third-party vendors is not mandatory if in-house destruction is effective and documented.

### Resource Constraints
- “Reasonable effort” means a process that is practical for the organization’s size and resources, but must ensure data is not recoverable.
- Lack of recent disposals is not a fail if a clear process exists for future disposals.

### Industry Context
- Organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, finance) should show extra diligence.
- For sectors with regulatory requirements, reference to those standards is a positive indicator.

---

## 6. Common Assessment Pitfalls

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming deleting files or formatting drives is sufficient.
- No documentation of disposal events.
- Relying on informal or verbal processes.

### Documentation Issues
- Missing or outdated certificates/logs.
- Photos that do not clearly show destruction.
- Policies that are generic or not tailored to the organization.

### False Positives
- Stating “we use a vendor” without naming the vendor or providing evidence.
- Claiming “we destroy drives” with no supporting documentation.

## 7. Scoring Guidance

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Has the organization described a secure disposal process?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Is there evidence of implementation (if disposals have occurred)?**
   - **No** (but no disposals have occurred) → Check if process is clear and actionable → PASS if yes, otherwise FAIL
   - **No** (disposals have occurred) → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Does the process ensure data is irrecoverable (physical destruction or certified service)?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, inconsistent, or appears fabricated, escalate to a senior auditor.
- If the process is described but not documented, request additional evidence or clarification.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards for evidence and process clarity across all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, practical, and documented process for secure hardware disposal, with supporting evidence where applicable. The process must ensure data is irrecoverable, either through physical destruction or use of a reputable third-party service. Responses lacking detail, evidence, or demonstrating unsafe practices should result in a FAIL. Adjust expectations for very small organizations, but do not compromise on the core requirement: data must not be recoverable from disposed assets.
