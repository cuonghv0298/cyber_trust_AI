            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
Organizations must ensure that all third parties or contractors who may access or handle sensitive information sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before being granted such access. The NDA must explicitly state disciplinary actions or consequences for breaching the agreement.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive organizational data by external parties.
- Establish legal and procedural recourse in the event of a data leak.
- Ensure third parties understand their obligations and the seriousness of data protection.

**Context & Importance:**  
Third parties and contractors often present a significant risk vector for data leakage. This provision ensures a basic legal safeguard is in place, even for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources, by requiring a formal NDA process that includes clear consequences for violations.

---

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### PASS Criteria
- The organization has an NDA template or form specifically for third parties/contractors.
- The NDA includes explicit clauses about disciplinary actions or consequences for breaches (e.g., contract termination, legal action, financial penalties).
- The organization can demonstrate that all relevant third parties/contractors have signed the NDA before accessing sensitive information.
- Evidence is current (within the last 12 months or since the last onboarding of a third party).

### FAIL Criteria
- No NDA exists for third parties/contractors.
- The NDA does not mention disciplinary actions or consequences for breaches.
- The organization cannot provide evidence that NDAs are signed by relevant third parties/contractors.
- The NDA is outdated, unsigned, or not relevant to current third-party engagements.

### Partial Compliance
- An NDA exists but lacks explicit disciplinary action clauses.
- Only some third parties/contractors have signed the NDA.
- The NDA is generic and not tailored to sensitive information or data protection.
- Evidence is incomplete or only covers a subset of third-party relationships.

---

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### Required Evidence Types
- Copy of the NDA template/form used for third parties/contractors.
- Signed NDA samples (with sensitive details redacted if necessary).
- List of third parties/contractors with corresponding NDA status.
- Onboarding checklist or process documentation referencing NDA signing.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- NDA must clearly reference data protection and disciplinary actions.
- Signatures/dates must be visible (redacted names are acceptable for privacy).
- Evidence should be recent and reflect current third-party relationships.

### Red Flags
- NDAs missing disciplinary action clauses.
- Evidence of unsigned or undated NDAs.
- NDAs that are not specific to third parties/contractors.
- No mapping between third-party access and NDA coverage.

---

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### What to Look For
- Existence of an NDA form for third parties/contractors.
- NDA content includes disciplinary action(s) for breaches.
- Confirmation that all relevant third parties/contractors have signed the NDA.
- Evidence is up-to-date and relevant to current third-party engagements.

### Acceptable Responses
- "Yes, we have an NDA template for all contractors and third parties. It includes a clause stating that breach of confidentiality may result in contract termination and legal action. All current contractors have signed this NDA. See attached template and signed copies."
- "Our onboarding checklist for third parties includes mandatory NDA signing. Attached are redacted signed NDAs and the template."

### Unacceptable Responses
- "We trust our contractors and do not use NDAs."
- "We have an NDA, but it does not mention disciplinary actions."
- "We only ask some contractors to sign NDAs."
- "No evidence provided."

### Follow-up Questions
- "Can you provide a copy of the NDA template used for third parties?"
- "Does the NDA explicitly state disciplinary actions for breaches?"
- "Can you show evidence that all current third parties/contractors with access to sensitive data have signed the NDA?"
- "When was the last time the NDA was reviewed or updated?"

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations, a simple NDA template and a basic tracking spreadsheet are sufficient.
- If no third parties/contractors are currently engaged, organization should state this and provide a template for future use.

### Resource Constraints
- A basic NDA template (even if downloaded and adapted) is acceptable if it covers the required clauses.
- Manual tracking of NDA signatures is acceptable for small teams.

### Industry Context
- Some sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance) may require stricter NDA terms; however, Cyber Essentials baseline only requires clear disciplinary action clauses.
- For organizations with only occasional third-party engagement, evidence of a ready-to-use NDA template is sufficient.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- NDAs lacking disciplinary action clauses.
- NDAs only used for employees, not third parties.
- No evidence of signed NDAs for current contractors.

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated NDA templates.
- Missing or incomplete signature pages.
- No mapping between third-party access and NDA coverage.

### False Positives
- Organization claims to have NDAs but cannot produce evidence.
- NDA template provided, but no proof of use with actual third parties.

---

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Does the organization have an NDA template/form for third parties/contractors?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

2. **Does the NDA include disciplinary action(s) for breaches?**
   - If NO → FAIL
   - If YES → proceed

3. **Can the organization provide evidence that all relevant third parties/contractors have signed the NDA?**
   - If NO → FAIL or PARTIAL (if some have signed)
   - If YES → PASS

4. **Is the evidence current and relevant?**
   - If NO → PARTIAL or FAIL
   - If YES → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, request additional documentation or clarification.
- If the NDA’s disciplinary action clause is vague, escalate to a senior auditor for interpretation.
- If the organization claims no third-party access, verify this claim with supporting documentation.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same PASS/FAIL logic to all organizations, regardless of size.
- Accept simple, practical solutions for small organizations, provided all required elements are present.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline or partial compliance cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for a clear, signed NDA process for third parties/contractors that includes disciplinary actions for breaches, supported by current and relevant evidence. Practical, proportionate implementation is acceptable, but all key elements must be present for a PASS.
