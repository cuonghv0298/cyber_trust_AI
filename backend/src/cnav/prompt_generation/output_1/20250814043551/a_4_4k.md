            ## Evaluation Prompt

            You will be given a list of self-assessment questions with answers and evidence filled by the organization under evaluation. Your task is to evaluate if each question PASSES or FAILS for this particular provision. Here are the evaluation criteria for this provision:

---

## 1. **Provision Overview**

**What the Provision Requires:**  
The organization must ensure that all employees are aware of the need to use only trusted network connections (such as corporate Wi-Fi, VPN, or secure mobile hotspots) when accessing organizational data or business email. This includes understanding the risks of using untrusted or public networks and knowing the correct procedures for connecting securely.

**Key Security Objectives:**  
- Prevent unauthorized access or interception of sensitive data via insecure networks.
- Reduce the risk of malware infection or data leakage through compromised or public Wi-Fi.
- Foster a security-aware culture among employees regarding safe network practices.

**Context & Importance:**  
Untrusted networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi) are common attack vectors for cybercriminals to intercept data or inject malware. Ensuring employees are aware of and use only trusted connections is a fundamental, cost-effective defense for organizations with limited cybersecurity resources.

---

## 2. **Evaluation Framework**

### PASS Criteria
- The organization demonstrates that employees are **explicitly informed** about the requirement to use trusted network connections for business data/email access.
- There is **evidence of awareness activities** (e.g., onboarding materials, policy documents, email reminders, or training sessions).
- Employees can **identify examples** of trusted (e.g., VPN, corporate Wi-Fi) and untrusted (e.g., public Wi-Fi at cafes) networks.
- The response covers **all relevant access scenarios** (office, remote, mobile).

### FAIL Criteria
- No evidence that employees are made aware of trusted network requirements.
- Vague or generic statements (e.g., “Employees know to be careful online”) without specifics.
- No mention of trusted/untrusted network types or examples.
- No supporting documentation or evidence of awareness activities.

### Partial Compliance
- Some awareness activities exist, but coverage is incomplete (e.g., only new hires, not all staff).
- Evidence is outdated or not organization-wide.
- Employees are aware in some contexts (e.g., office) but not others (e.g., remote work).
- Requires follow-up to clarify scope or recency.

## 3. **Evidence Assessment Guidelines**

### Required Evidence Types
- Employee communications (emails, memos) about network use.
- Excerpts from onboarding or security awareness training materials.
- Acceptable Use Policy or IT policy referencing network connection requirements.
- Screenshots or records of training completion.
- Survey results or attestations from staff.

### Evidence Quality Standards
- Evidence should be **recent** (within the last 12 months).
- Should **explicitly mention** trusted network connections and provide examples.
- Should demonstrate **organization-wide coverage** (not just IT staff).

### Red Flags
- Evidence is undated or several years old.
- Only policy documents with no proof of employee communication or training.
- Evidence refers only to “secure connections” without defining or exemplifying.
- No evidence provided, or evidence is clearly generic or templated.

## 4. **Question-by-Question Evaluation Instructions**

### What to Look For
- Clear statement that employees are **informed/trained** about using trusted networks.
- Specific mention of **VPN, corporate Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot** as trusted options.
- Examples or definitions of **untrusted networks** (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
- Evidence that **all employees** (not just IT) are covered.

### Acceptable Responses
- “All staff receive annual security awareness training that includes a section on using only corporate Wi-Fi or VPN for accessing business email and data. See attached training slides and attendance records.”
- “Our Acceptable Use Policy, distributed to all employees, states that only trusted networks (corporate Wi-Fi, VPN, or personal mobile hotspot) may be used for business access. See attached policy and distribution email.”
- “Onboarding checklist includes a briefing on network security. See onboarding document and signed acknowledgment forms.”

### Unacceptable Responses
- “We tell staff to be careful online.”
- “We have a policy, but it’s only for IT staff.”
- “No formal communication, but employees know not to use public Wi-Fi.”
- “No evidence provided.”

### Follow-up Questions
- “How are remote or mobile employees made aware of these requirements?”
- “When was the last time this information was communicated to staff?”
- “Can you provide a sample of the communication or training material?”
- “How do you ensure new hires are informed?”

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**

### Organization Size Scaling
- For very small organizations (e.g., <10 staff), informal but **documented communication** (e.g., group email, team meeting notes) is acceptable.
- For larger organizations, expect more formalized and repeatable processes.

### Resource Constraints
- Awareness can be achieved through simple, low-cost means (e.g., email reminders, short training videos).
- No requirement for expensive training platforms or complex policy management.

### Industry Context
- Sectors with high remote work (e.g., consulting, sales) should show evidence relevant to mobile/remote scenarios.
- Sectors with mostly on-premises work may have simpler requirements but must still address remote access if it occurs.

---

## 6. **Common Assessment Pitfalls**

### Typical Compliance Gaps
- Assuming verbal or informal communication is sufficient without documentation.
- Only IT staff are informed, not all employees.
- Outdated or one-off awareness activities.

### Documentation Issues
- Missing dates or recipient lists for communications.
- Policies that mention “secure connections” but do not define or exemplify.

### False Positives
- Evidence of a general security policy without specific reference to network connection requirements.
- Training materials that do not mention trusted/untrusted networks.

## 7. **Scoring Guidance**

### Clear PASS/FAIL Decision Tree

1. **Is there evidence that all employees are made aware of the need to use trusted network connections?**
   - **No** → FAIL
   - **Yes** → Proceed

2. **Does the evidence explicitly mention trusted network types (e.g., VPN, corporate Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot) and provide examples?**
   - **No** → FAIL or Partial (if partially addressed)
   - **Yes** → Proceed

3. **Is the evidence recent and organization-wide?**
   - **No** → Partial (request update or clarification)
   - **Yes** → PASS

### Escalation Criteria
- If evidence is ambiguous, outdated, or only partially covers the requirement, escalate for senior auditor review or request additional evidence.

### Consistency Standards
- Apply the same standards to all organizations of similar size and sector.
- Document rationale for PASS/FAIL decisions, especially in borderline cases.

---

**Summary:**  
Auditors should look for clear, recent, and organization-wide evidence that employees are made aware of the need to use trusted network connections for business data/email access, with specific examples and coverage of all relevant scenarios. Responses lacking documentation, specificity, or recency should be marked as FAIL or Partial, with follow-up as needed. Adjust expectations proportionally for very small organizations, but always require some documented evidence.
