Introduction  
 
Digitalisation creates new opportunities, and COVID-19 has accelerated the rise of the digital economy. 
An increasingly digital way of life also increases organisational and individual exposure to cyber risks. 
Cybersecurity is a critical enabler of Singapore’s digital economy. There is a need to build confidence 
in organisations to enable them to pursue the opportunities from digitalisation. Cybersecurity incidents 
often result in financial losses, tarnish business reputation and affect customers’ trust, negating 
business investments and customers’ confidence in the digital economy. 
 
This document described tiered cybersecurity standards that are designed to support the cybersecurity 
needs of a range of organisations. A framework has been developed to provide a guided approach to 
help organisations in their journey towards the implementation of cybersecurity in the organisation. 
 
 
2 
Scope  
 
Organisations differ in terms of the nature of their business, size (which may be measured by 
parameters such as capital turnover or employment size) and the extent of digitalisation in their 
businesses. These have a corresponding impact on their cybersecurity risk profile. The CSA 
cybersecurity certification takes on a tiered approach to address different business profiles and needs 
as follows: 
 
–  
The Cyber Essentials mark takes on a baseline control approach and is intended to protect 
organisations against the most common cyberattacks; and 
 
–  
The Cyber Trust mark takes on a risk-based approach and is intended to enable organisations 
to put in place the relevant cybersecurity preparedness measures that commensurate with their 
cybersecurity risk profile. 
 
Together, the Cyber Essentials mark and Cyber Trust mark provide a cybersecurity risk management 
framework for organisations. The Cyber Trust mark can be construed as a trust mark of distinction that 
recognizes the cybersecurity measures implemented in the organisation. 
 
This document elaborates further on the Cyber Essentials mark.

4.1 
Concepts and principles 
 
The Cyber Essentials mark is targeted at organisations with limited Information Technology (IT) and/or 
cybersecurity expertise and resources to dedicate towards protecting IT assets and personnel.  
 
The key objective of the Cyber Essentials mark is to enable organisations with limited resources for 
cybersecurity to prioritise the cybersecurity measures needed, so that they can be protected against 
common cyberattacks. The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is a relevant guiding 
principle.

COPYRIGHT 
 
To simplify the implementation for organisations that are just starting out in their digitalisation and/or 
cybersecurity journey, the Cyber Essentials mark helps enterprises to prioritise the essential 
cybersecurity measures needed to protect the organisations against common, non-targeted attacks. 
 
The Cyber Essentials mark also serves as a badge to recognise organisations that observe good cyber 
hygiene. 
 
The security measures for the Cyber Essentials mark are organised in five (5) categories, listed in Table 
1.

4.2 
Organisation profile 
 
Organisations should establish if there is a match between the business needs and the protection and/or 
recognition accorded from being certified with the Cyber Essentials mark.  
 
The cybersecurity posture of an organisation depends on multiple factors and is different from 
organisation to organisation. The Cyber Essentials mark is targeted at resource-constrained 
organisations with limited IT and/or cybersecurity expertise and resources to dedicate towards 
protecting IT assets and personnel.

COPYRIGHT 
Organisations with a higher risk profile and/or more resources for cybersecurity should invest in more 
comprehensive cybersecurity measures. Such organisations should also consider applying for the 
Cyber Trust2 mark. 
 
4.3 
Boundary of scope and statement of scope 
 
Organisations should establish the boundary of scope for certification and determine the assessable 
components of the organisation’s environment for the certification of the Cyber Essentials mark. 
 
The scope of assessment and certification can cover the whole of the organisation’s IT infrastructure, 
or a subset, e.g., a specific business unit, process or location. This is usually the subset that is critical 
or important for the organisation’s core business. The organisation is also encouraged to include the 
whole IT infrastructure within the scope of assessment and certification, where feasible, so as to achieve 
the best protection. 
 
The boundary of scope shall be clearly defined, including as follows:  
 
– 
The business unit(s) involved; 
– 
The network boundary; 
– 
The devices and/or systems within the scope;  
– 
The software and/or services within the scope; and 
– 
The physical location(s).  
 
The scope of assessment and certification shall be agreed between the organisation applying for 
certification and the certification body before assessment begins. The scope of assessment and 
certification shall be documented and the documentation shall include the following: 
 
– 
The organisation chart depicting the business unit(s) within the scope; 
– 
The context of the organisation’s business; 
– 
A system and network diagram; 
– 
An inventory listing of devices and/or systems;  
– 
An inventory listing of software and/or services; 
– 
Locations from where the organisation operates or carries out the services that are to be 
covered as part of the certification; and 
– 
The Cyber Essentials mark self-assessment performed by the organisation. 
 
The requirements for Cyber Essentials mark shall apply to all devices3, systems4 and software that are 
within this boundary of scope. 
 
The organisation applying for certification shall also define the statement of scope used to describe the 
scope of certification. In developing the statement of scope, the organisation may consider the following 
guiding principles: 
 
 
2 CSA Cybersecurity Certification: Cyber Trust mark 
3 For organisations that implement Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), where employees use their own personal 
mobile devices for company tasks to access organisational data or services, the scope of assessment and 
certification will include such devices. 
4 For organisations that adopt cloud-based software, the scope of assessment and certification will include such 
cloud-based services.

platform”.  
 
c) If the organisation applying for certification conducts its business operations in multiple sites, the 
statement of scope can also make reference to the location of the site(s) included within the scope.  
 
d) The organisations may also consider taking on a phased approach, by starting with a smaller or 
narrow scope initially and gradually expanding the scope of certification over time.  
 
4.4 
Pre-certification preparation by the organisation 
 
Prior to engaging a certification body, the organisation shall complete the guided self-assessment 
template required for Cyber Essentials mark certification. 
 
This consists of a list of requirements and recommendations that the organisation shall assess and 
indicate if these have been implemented in the organisation. 
 
4.5 
Independent assessment by certification body 
 
Following the completion of its self-assessment, the organisation shall approach any of the certification 
bodies appointed by CSA for independent assessment and issuance of the Cyber Essentials mark 
certification. 
 
When assessors from the organisation’s selected certification body evaluate the organisation’s 
application for certification, the assessors may apply professional judgement based on the business 
context of the organisation. 
 
Assessors may perform inspection of documents and other artefacts to evaluate the relevant 
documentation and design of the cybersecurity measures implemented in the organisation. 
 
For the organisation to be certified for Cyber Essentials mark, the organisation shall meet all the 
requirements. 
 
4.6 
Certification life cycle 
 
Once the Cyber Essentials mark certification has been issued to an organisation, the certification shall 
remain valid for a period of two (2) years. 
 
After the 2-year validity of the Cyber Essentials mark certification, the organisation may select to re-
certify its Cyber Essentials mark certification. Alternatively, the organisation may also consider seeking 
Cyber Trust mark certification if its risk profile has changed.

 Cyber Essentials mark – Requirements and recommendations 
 
 
A.1 
Assets: People – Equip employees with know-how to be the first line of 
defence 
 
A.1.1 
Introduction 
 
Employees are the first line of defence in the organisation, and the weakest link in the security chain as 
cyber attackers increasingly use social engineering techniques to target them for their agenda. 
Therefore, it is essential for all employees in the organisation to be well-trained to identify these 
techniques, mitigate them and report any suspected incidents. 
 
A.1.2 
Applicability 
 
All employees within the scope of assessment and certification in the organisation that have access to 
the organisation’s IT assets and/or environment. 
 
A.1.3 
Objective 
 
To actively instil cybersecurity awareness in the organisation across all levels of employees in the 
organisation. In addition, encourage the cultivation of a culture of shared responsibility in cybersecurity 
within the organisation. 
 
A.1.4 
Provisions 
 
The provisions for equipping the employees to be the first line of defence are as follows: 
 
a) 
The organisation shall put in place cybersecurity awareness training for all employees to ensure 
that employees are aware of the security practices and behaviour expected of them. Organisations 
may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., provide self-learning materials for employees or 
engaging external training providers. 
 
b) 
Cyber hygiene practices and guidelines shall be developed for employees to adopt in their daily 
operations. 
 
c) 
The cyber hygiene practices and guidelines should include topics to mitigate cybersecurity 
incidents arising from the human factor as follows: 
 
– 
Protect yourself from phishing; 
– 
Set strong passphrase and protect them; 
– 
Protect your corporate and/or personal devices (used for work); 
– 
Report cybersecurity incidents; 
– 
Handle and disclose business-critical data carefully; and 
– 
Work onsite and remotely in a secure manner.

COPYRIGHT 
d) 
Where feasible, the training content should be differentiated based on the role of the employees: 
 
– 
Senior management or business leaders – e.g., developing a cybersecurity culture/mindset in 
the organisation or establishing a cybersecurity strategy or workplan. 
– 
Employees – e.g., using strong passphrases and protecting the corporate and/or personal 
devices used for work. 
 
e) 
As good practice, such cybersecurity awareness initiatives should be conducted at least annually 
to refresh employees’ awareness. 
 
 
A.2 
Assets: Hardware and software – Know what hardware and software the 
organisation has and protect them 
 
A.2.1 
Introduction 
 
Knowledge about the environment is the foundation of an effective cybersecurity strategy. Taking stock 
of the hardware and software in the organisation is a foundational step to monitor and protect them; 
ensuring that the assets are (i) authorised to access the organisation’s environment, and (ii) secured 
properly. 
 
A.2.2 
Applicability 
 
Hardware within the scope of assessment and certification includes the organisation’s assets such as 
end-user devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, as well as portable and mobile devices 
such as tablets and mobile phones), network devices such as firewalls and routers, non-standard 
computing devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and servers (e.g., email, web and 
application servers).  
 
Software within the scope of assessment and certification includes business applications, online 
accounts for which the business email address is used and other applications accessed either locally 
or remotely via the devices. 
 
A.2.3 
Objective 
 
To actively manage the hardware and software assets in the organisation’s environment. Having 
visibility of what assets belong to the organisation allows for steps to be taken to monitor and protect 
these assets. Active asset management also ensures that only authorised assets and devices are used 
and only authorised software are installed. 
 
A.2.4 
Provisions 
 
The provisions for identifying and protecting what hardware and software the organisation has, and 
securing them, are as follows: 
 
a) An up-to-date asset inventory of all the hardware and software assets shall be maintained in the 
organisation. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., use of spreadsheet 
or IT asset management software to maintain the IT asset inventory.

d) Software assets within the scope of certification may include software applications used by the 
organisation. If the scope of certification includes a cloud environment: 
 
Cloud 
– 
Organisation shall include what is hosted on the cloud instances, e.g., 
software and Operating System (OS). 
 
e) The inventory list should contain the details of the software assets where available, as follows: 
 
– 
Software name; 
– 
Software publisher; 
– 
Software version; 
– 
Business purpose; 
– 
Asset classification; 
– 
Approval/authorised date; and 
– 
EOS date. 
 
f) 
As good practice, the hardware and software asset inventory list should be reviewed at least bi-
annually (twice per year). 
 
g) Hardware and software assets that are unauthorised or have reached their respective EOS shall 
be replaced. 
 
 
5 The asset tag is intended to provide unique identification for each of the asset, e.g., it can be concatenated with 
acronyms of the asset type, department prefix and a running number to form a unique identifier. 
CSA Cybersecurity Certification: Cyber Essentials mark 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
COPYRIGHT 
h) In the event of any continued use of EOS assets, the organisation shall assess and understand the 
risk, obtain approval from senior management, and monitor it until the asset is replaced. 
 
i) 
An authorisation process shall be developed to onboard new hardware and software into the 
organisation. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., email approval from 
senior management, ensuring that new hardware and software come from official or trusted 
sources, performing malware scans to verify that the asset is clean and maintaining asset 
whitelisting/blacklisting. 
 
j) 
The date of authorisation of software and hardware shall be keyed into the asset inventory list after 
obtaining the relevant dispensation, e.g., obtaining email approval or through the use of an approval 
form. 
 
k) Software and hardware without approval dates shall be removed. 
 
l) 
Before disposing of any hardware asset, the organisation shall ensure that all confidential 
information have been deleted, e.g., encrypting hard disk before reformatting and overwriting it. 
 
m) The organisation should carry out steps to ensure that the assets are disposed of securely and 
completely, e.g., destroy the hard disks physically or engage disk shredding services. 
 
 
A.3 
Assets: Data – Know what data the organisation has, where they are, and 
secure the data 
 
A.3.1 
Introduction 
 
Data is the organisation’s most valuable business asset. Identifying the critical data in the organisation 
is the key foundational step to classify, monitor, and protect to ensure that only authorised employees 
can access it.  
 
A.3.2 
Applicability 
 
Data within the scope of assessment and certification includes raw and unorganised facts such as 
numbers or text on paper, bits and bytes stored in electronic memory, system memory size, employee 
names, product names, addresses and costs of service.  
 
A.3.3 
Objective 
 
To actively manage data in the organisation’s environment. Having visibility of what type of data the 
organisation is collecting, processing and storing allows for steps to be taken to monitor and protect the 
data from unauthorised access and/or disclosure. 
 
A.3.4 
Provisions 
 
The provisions for knowing what data the organisation has, where they are and securing them are as 
follows: 
 
CSA Cybersecurity Certification: Cyber Essentials mark 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13 
COPYRIGHT 
a) 
The organisation shall identify and maintain an inventory of business-critical data6 in the 
organisation. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., using spreadsheet 
or asset inventory software. The inventory list shall contain details of the data as follows: 
 
– 
Description; 
– 
Data classification and/or sensitivity; 
– 
Location; and 
– 
Retention period. 
 
b) 
Review of the inventory list should be carried out at least annually, or whenever there is any change 
to the data captured by the organisation. 
 
c) 
The organisation shall establish a process to protect its business-critical data, e.g., password 
protected documents, encryption of personal data (at rest) and/or emails. 
 
d) 
There shall also be measures in place to prevent the employees from leaking confidential and/or 
sensitive data outside of the organisation, e.g., disabling USB ports. 
 
e) 
Before disposing of any paper-based (hard copy) media, the organisation shall carry out steps to 
ensure that those containing confidential and/or sensitive data have been securely shredded. 
 
 
A.4 
Secure/Protect: Virus and malware protection – Protect from malicious 
software like viruses and malware 
 
A.4.1 
Introduction 
 
Malicious software (or malware) is a key threat faced in the organisation when hardware and software 
are connected to the Internet. Malware is designed to attack the systems, devices and steal data. It can 
also enter through end-user devices, email attachments, web pages, cloud services, user actions, and 
removable media. Malware can also evolve rapidly, which is why it is important to keep the detection of 
malware updated frequently to stay protected against the latest malware. 
 
A.4.2 
Applicability 
 
Hardware within the scope of assessment and certification includes the organisation’s assets such as 
end-user devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, as well as portable and mobile devices 
such as tablets and mobile phones), network devices such as firewalls and routers, non-standard 
computing devices such as IoT devices and servers (e.g., email, web and application servers) including 
the organisation’s system hosted in cloud.  
 
Software within the scope of assessment and certification includes those installed in servers, desktop 
computers, laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, firewalls, routers, storage solutions, and 
virtualisation platforms. 
 
 
 
 
6 This includes confidential and/or sensitive data, including personal data. Examples include data within the 
organisation such as product, staff and/or financial data that is vital to the operation of the organisation, and where 
exposing them can lead to potential financial losses and/or legal issues. 
CSA Cybersecurity Certification: Cyber Essentials mark

COPYRIGHT 
A.4.3 
Objective 
 
To ensure that sufficient protection measures are in place to continuously monitor and defend against 
malicious software, as such malicious software can result in unauthorised access to the organisation’s 
network and cause damage to the organisation’s environment. 
 
A.4.4 
Provisions 
 
The provisions for protecting the organisation from malicious software are as follows: 
 
a) Anti-malware solutions shall be used and installed in endpoints to detect attacks on the 
organisation’s environment. Examples of endpoints include laptop computers, desktop computers, 
servers and virtual environments. 
 
b) Virus and malware scans shall be carried out to detect possible cyberattacks. Where feasible, scans 
should always be automated and remain active to provide constant protection. 
 
c) Organisations shall enable auto-updates or configure the anti-malware solution to update signature 
files or equivalent (e.g., non-signature based machine learning solutions) to detect new malware. 
Where possible, these updates should take place at least daily to stay protected from the latest 
malware. 
 
d) Anti-malware solution shall be configured to automatically scan the files upon access. This includes 
files and attachments downloaded from the Internet through the web browser or email and external 
sources such as from portable USB drives. 
 
e) If the scope of certification includes mobile devices, IoT devices, cloud environment or use of web 
browser/email: 
 
Mobile devices 
– 
Anti-malware solution should be installed and running on mobile 
devices. 
IoT devices 
– 
Anti-malware solution should be integrated with the IoT devices, e.g., 
CCTV, smart television, smart printers, digital door lock. 
Cloud 
– 
Anti-malware solution should be deployed on the cloud platform. 
Web browser/ 
email 
– 
Only fully supported web browsers and email client software with 
security controls should be used. 
– 
Anti-phishing and spam filtering tools should be established for the web 
browser/email client software. 
– 
Web browsers and/or email plug-ins/extensions/add-ons that are not 
necessary should be disabled and/or removed. 
– 
Web filtering should be deployed to protect the business from malicious 
sites, where feasible. 
 
f) 
Firewalls shall be deployed or switched on to protect the network, systems, and endpoints such as 
laptops, desktops, servers, and virtual environments. In an environment where there is an 
organisation’s network setup, a network perimeter firewall shall be configured to analyse and accept 
only authorised network traffic into the organisation’s network. Examples can include packet filter, 
Domain Name System (DNS) firewall and application-level gateway firewall with rules to restrict

COPYRIGHT 
and filter network traffic. Depending on the organisation’s network setup, the firewall functionality 
may be integrated with other networking devices or be a standalone device. 
 
g) In an environment where there are endpoints connecting to the Internet and/or cloud-based 
applications, a software firewall (host-based firewall) should be configured and switched on for all 
the endpoints in the organisation where available, e.g., turning on the built-in software firewall 
feature included in most operating systems or anti-malware solutions. 
 
h) As good practice, firewall configurations and rules should ideally be reviewed and verified annually 
to protect the organisation’s Internet-facing assets where applicable. 
 
i) 
If the scope of certification includes mobile and/or IoT devices: 
 
Mobile devices 
– 
It is recommended that firewalls should be installed and enabled on 
employees’ mobile devices. 
IoT devices 
– 
It is recommended that firewalls should be configured and enabled on 
IoT devices where possible. 
 
j)

Secure/Protect: Access control – Control access to the organisation’s 
data and services 
 
A.5.1 
Introduction 
 
Active user accounts and physical access are the source of entry to the hardware and software in the 
organisation’s environment. Ensuring that only authorised users are given the access rights they need 
to perform their work helps to reduce the risk of information being stolen, or hardware and software 
being compromised. 
 
A.5.2 
Applicability 
 
Hardware within the scope of assessment and certification includes the organisation’s assets such as 
end-user devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, as well as portable and mobile devices 
such as tablets and mobile phones), network devices such as firewalls and routers, non-standard 
computing devices such as IoT devices and servers (e.g., email, web and application servers) including 
the organisation’s system hosted in the cloud.

environment by employees and other third parties, including contractors. 
 
A.5.4 
Provisions 
 
The provisions for controlling who has access to the organisation’s data and system are as follows: 
 
a) Account management shall be established to maintain and manage the inventory of accounts. The 
organisation may meet this in different ways, e.g., using of spreadsheets or exporting the list from 
software directory services. 
 
b) The account inventory list shall contain details for user, administrator, third-party, and service 
accounts not limited to the following: 
 
– 
Name; 
– 
Username; 
– 
Department; 
– 
Role/account type; 
– 
Date of access created; and 
– 
Last logon date. 
 
c) The organisation shall have a process with the necessary approvals to grant and revoke access. 
The organisation may implement this in different ways, e.g., email approval or access request form. 
This shall be implemented when there are personnel changes such as onboarding of new staff or 
change of role(s) for employees. The following fields shall be captured as follows: 
 
– 
Name; 
– 
System to access; 
– 
Department; 
– 
Role/account type; 
– 
From date; and 
– 
To date. 
 
d) Access shall be managed to ensure employees can access only the information and systems 
required for their job role. 
 
e) Accounts with access rights that are no longer required or have exceeded the requested date shall 
have their access disabled or removed from the system. Shared, duplicate, obsolete and invalid 
accounts shall be removed.

g) Access shall be managed to ensure that third parties or contractors can access only the information 
and systems required for their job role. Such access shall be removed once they no longer require 
them. 
 
h) Third parties or contractors working with sensitive information in the organisation shall sign a non-
disclosure agreement form. The form should include disciplinary action(s) for failure to abide by the 
agreement. 
 
i) 
Physical access control shall be enforced to allow only authorised employees/contractors to access 
the organisation’s IT assets and/or environment, e.g., use of cable lock to lock the workstations and 
card access door lock to authenticate and authorise entry. 
 
j) 
As good practice, account reviews should be carried out at least quarterly or whenever there are 
changes to the account list, e.g., during onboarding and offboarding processes or organisation 
restructuring. 
 
k) Dormant or inactive accounts which have been inactive for a prolonged period, e.g., sixty (60) days 
should be removed or disabled. 
 
l) 
The organisation shall change all default passwords and replace them with a strong passphrase, 
e.g., it should be at least twelve (12) characters long and include upper case, lower case, and/or 
special characters. 
 
m) User accounts shall be disabled and/or locked out after multiple failed login attempts, e.g., after ten 
(10) failed login attempts, ’throttling’ the rate of attempts7. 
 
n) The account password shall be changed in the event of any suspected compromise. 
 
o) Where feasible, two-factor authentication (2FA) should be used for administrative access to 
important systems, such as an Internet- facing system containing sensitive or business-critical data. 
Organisations may implement this in different ways, e.g., use of an authenticator application on the 
mobile or one-time password (OTP) token.  
 
p) Where feasible, trusted software to manage passphrases should be used to aide employee 
passphrase management.

recommendations and standards such as Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks on 
configuration guidelines across multiple vendor products, running baseline security analyser and/or 
using system configuration scripts. 
 
b) Weak or default configurations shall be avoided or updated before using them, e.g., changing 
default password and performing deep scanning with anti-malware solution instead of standard 
scan. 
 
c) Insecure configurations and weak protocols shall be replaced or upgraded to address the 
associated vulnerabilities, e.g., using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) over normal 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to encrypt data communication and upgrading Wired 
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) to Wi-Fi Protected Access 2/3 (WPA2/WPA3) to enhance the Wi-Fi 
security standards. 
 
d) Features, services, or applications that are not in used shall be disabled or removed, e.g., disabling 
file sharing services, software macros and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) ports.  
 
e) Automatic connection to open networks and auto-run feature of non-essential programs (other than 
backup or anti-malware solution, etc.) shall be disabled. 
 
f) 
Logging should also be enabled for software and hardware assets where feasible, e.g., system, 
events and security logs.

A.8 
Backup: Back up essential data – Back up the organisation’s essential 
data and store them offline 
 
A.8.1 
Introduction 
 
Data backups are critical in enabling quick recovery from cybersecurity incidents such as ransomware 
or malware, but also physical incidents such as system failure, theft, or natural disasters. 
 
A.8.2 
Applicability 
 
Essential business information within the scope of assessment and certification refers to information 
that is needed to restore services or operations of the organisation. 
 
A.8.3 
Objective 
 
To ensure regular back up of all essential business information in a secure manner so that the 
organisation is able to restore and recover its business operations when cybersecurity incidents take 
place. 
 
A.8.4 
Provisions 
 
The provisions for backing up essential data and storing them securely offline are as follows: 
 
a) 
The organisation shall identify business-critical systems and those containing essential business 
information and perform backup. What needs to be backed up is guided by identifying what is 
needed for business recovery in the event of a cybersecurity incident. Examples of business-critical

systems include stock-trading system, railway operating and control system. Examples of essential 
business information include financial data and business transactions. 
 
b) The backups shall be performed on a regular basis, with the backup frequency aligned to the 
business requirements and how many days’ worth of data the organisation can afford to lose. 
 
c) For non-business-critical systems or non-essential information, the backups should still be 
performed but at/on a lower frequency/long term basis. 
 
d) The backup process should be automated where feasible. 
 
e) If the scope of certification includes cloud environment: 
 
Cloud 
– 
The organisation shall understand the role and responsibility between 
itself and the CSP in terms of data backup, e.g., cloud shared 
responsibility model, scope, and coverage of the cloud service. 
– 
Data backup shall be carried out by the organisation, e.g., storing the 
backups in a hard disk drive, purchasing the backup services by the 
CSP, and adopting multiple clouds to be used as backups. 
 
f) 
If the scope of certification includes hardware assets such as mobile devices and/or IoT devices: 
 
Mobile devices 
– 
Essential business information stored in mobile phones should be auto 
backed up and transferred to a secondary mobile phone or secondary 
storage for backup, e.g., SMS conversations or contact of an important 
client. 
IoT devices 
– 
IoT devices containing the organisation’s essential information should 
be backed up manually where automatic backup is not available, e.g., 
sensors in farms to improve operational safety and efficiency and in 
healthcare to monitor patients with greater precision to provide timely 
treatment. 
 
g) All backups shall be protected from unauthorised access and be restricted to authorised personnel 
only. Backups should minimally be password-protected. 
 
h) Backups shall be stored separately (i.e., offline) from the operating environment. Where feasible, 
backups should be stored offsite, e.g., separate physical location. 
 
i) 
Frequent backups such as daily or weekly backups should be stored online to facilitate quick 
recovery, e.g., cloud backup storage. 
 
j) 
Longer term backups such as monthly backups shall be stored offline in an external secure storage 
location, e.g., password-protected USB flash drives, encrypted external hard disks and/or tape 
storage at an alternative office location. 
 
k) As good practice, backups should be tested at least bi-annually, or more frequently, to ensure that 
business-critical systems and essential business information can be restored effectively.
