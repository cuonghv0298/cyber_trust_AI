Question - Answering:
Great — let’s now zoom in on the entities directly involved in the evaluation process for determining whether a company or organization passes or fails the Cyber Essentials mark certification. This includes only those entities that have a functional or structural role in assessment, verification, compliance checking, and certification issuance.

⸻

✅ Key Evaluation Entities in Cyber Essentials Certification

Below are the essential entities directly involved in the pass/fail determination:

⸻

1. Organization (Applicant)

The subject being evaluated.
Responsibilities:
	•	Define scope (systems, units, devices).
	•	Perform self-assessment against all mandatory requirements.
	•	Implement required security controls in practice.
	•	Provide documentation and evidence to the Certification Body.

Outputs for Evaluation:
	•	Statement of scope.
	•	Completed self-assessment template.
	•	Inventory lists (hardware, software, data).
	•	Security policies (access control, incident response, etc.).
	•	Technical evidence (screenshots, logs, configurations).

⸻

2. Cyber Essentials Requirements (Annex A)

The benchmark used to evaluate compliance.
Nature:
	•	Prescriptive list of mandatory requirements (shall) and recommendations (should) across 9 categories.

Function in Evaluation:
	•	Serves as the authoritative reference for what must be implemented.
	•	Used as the checklist by both the organization (for self-assessment) and certification body (for audit).

Structure:
	•	Each requirement has:
	•	Applicability
	•	Objective
	•	Provisions (actions/evidence required)

⸻

3. Certification Body (Assessor)

The independent auditor who performs the final evaluation and judgment.
Responsibilities:
	•	Review the self-assessment and scope definition.
	•	Examine submitted evidence and conduct interviews or inspections.
	•	Use professional judgment to assess adequacy and completeness.
	•	Decide Pass / Fail based on:
	•	Whether all “shall” provisions are satisfied.
	•	Whether controls are effective within defined scope.

⸻

4. Self-Assessment Template

The organization’s declaration of conformity to all requirements.
Use in Evaluation:
	•	Guides the initial evaluation.
	•	Acts as input evidence to the Certification Body.
	•	Reveals gaps or non-conformities before formal audit.

⸻

5. Scope Statement & Documentation Set

Defines what parts of the organization are being assessed.
Includes:
	•	Org chart of in-scope units.
	•	System and network diagrams.
	•	Inventories of hardware/software/data.
	•	Location and cloud service mappings.

Use in Evaluation:
	•	Determines the boundary to which requirements apply.
	•	Ensures all requirements are checked within their relevant context (e.g., BYOD, cloud, IoT).

⸻

6. Evidence Artifacts

Concrete proofs submitted for each control.
Examples:
	•	Anti-virus scan reports.
	•	Firewall configurations.
	•	User account access records.
	•	Incident response plans.
	•	Training completion logs.

Use in Evaluation:
	•	Validates that the stated controls are implemented in practice, not just on paper.
	•	Supports assessor’s judgment of compliance.

🎯 Certification Decision Criteria

An organization passes if:
	1.	All shall provisions are implemented and verifiable.
	2.	Scope documentation is clear and complete.
	3.	Evidence is sufficient, timely, and consistent with claims.
	4.	Assessor judgment confirms no critical deficiencies.

Otherwise, it fails and must remediate before reapplying.

Excellent questions — they show you’re thinking deeply and systematically about how the Cyber Essentials mark certification process works.

Let’s answer your questions one by one with high fidelity based on the CSA Cyber Essentials documentation.

⸻

📌 Q1: What is the relationship between self-assessment and the certification body?

Answer:
	•	The organization completes the self-assessment before approaching a Certification Body.
	•	The Certification Body uses the self-assessment as an input to:
	•	Understand what the organization claims it has implemented.
	•	Use it as a checklist or roadmap during their independent assessment.

✅ So yes, the Certification Body contains or receives the self-assessment document, but does not rely on it alone — it performs its own audit and evidence inspection.

⸻

📌 Q2: Are the mandatory requirements (“shall”/“should”) defined per category or per provision?

Answer:
	•	They are defined per provision, not per category.

Each control category (e.g., A.1 Assets: People) contains multiple provisions (e.g., a, b, c…)
Each of these provisions is labeled with “shall” (mandatory) or “should” (recommended).

✅ So the unit of obligation is the individual provision.

Example:

From Section A.1.4:

a) The organization shall put in place cybersecurity awareness training for all employees… ← shall = mandatory
b) Cyber hygiene practices and guidelines shall be developed… ← shall
e) As good practice, such initiatives should be conducted at least annually ← should = recommended

⸻

📌 Q3: Is your hypothesis about the evaluation process correct?

“The organization completes the self-assessment by filling questions grouped by categories and provides evidence for each question that requires it → certification body audits based on it.”

Answer:
✅ Yes, this is broadly correct. Here’s the formalized version of the end-to-end process:

⸻

🔄 Cyber Essentials Evaluation Workflow

1. Pre-Certification (Self-Preparation by Organization)
	•	Define scope (systems, locations, business units, etc.)
	•	Collect and prepare:
	•	Inventory lists (devices, software, data)
	•	Policies, procedures, and evidence artifacts
	•	Complete the self-assessment template (check compliance against every provision)

2. Certification Application
	•	Submit to Certification Body:
	•	Self-assessment results
	•	Scope documentation
	•	Supporting evidence

3. Independent Assessment (By Certification Body Auditor)
	•	Validate self-assessment answers
	•	Inspect documentation (e.g., training logs, system configs)
	•	Review evidence artifacts
	•	Conduct interviews or site visits if necessary
	•	Map findings against the Annex A provisions (per scope)

4. Decision: PASS / FAIL
	•	Based on fulfillment of all shall provisions within the defined scope
	•	Issued with certification valid for 2 years
	•	If non-compliance, org can remediate and reapply

⸻

📌 Q4: What is the relationship between category and provision?

Answer:
✅ A category contains multiple provisions.

Example:
	•	Category A.1 – Assets: People
	•	a) Awareness training shall be conducted…
	•	b) Cyber hygiene practices shall be developed…
	•	c) Practices should cover phishing, passphrases…
	•	…

Think of the hierarchy as:

Cyber Essentials Requirements
 └── Category A.1
      ├── Provision a) (shall)
      ├── Provision b) (shall)
      ├── Provision c) (should)
      ...


⸻

📌 Q5: About Certification Body Decision: Is failure of one shall provision enough to fail certification?

Answer: ✅ Yes.

From the Cyber Essentials document:

“For the organisation to be certified for Cyber Essentials mark, the organisation shall meet all the requirements.”
→ (Section 4.5 – Independent assessment)

This means:
	•	If even one “shall” provision is not met, the org fails certification.
	•	The Certification Body must still complete the full evaluation, but the org cannot pass until all mandatory provisions are compliant.
	•	The “should” provisions are not mandatory and do not affect pass/fail, but help improve maturity.

  "organization": {
    "name": "string",
    "scope_statement": "string",
    "locations": ["string"],
    "systems_in_scope": ["string"]
  },

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


⸻

🗂️ Evidence Submission — Granularity

Each provision (not each category) requires its own specific evidence.
✔️ So evidence is submitted per provision, not as a single file per category.
	•	Some provisions need documentation (e.g., training policies).
	•	Others need screenshots (e.g., firewall settings).
	•	Some require both.

🧪 Simulated Audit Example

Here’s a short simulation of how a certification body might judge a sample organization:

evaluation_summary:
  total_shall_provisions: 78
  fully_covered: 77
  failed: 1
  status: FAIL

failing_provision:
  id: "A.6.a"
  category: "Secure Configuration"
  requirement: "Security configurations shall be enforced..."
  auditor_comment: "Default admin credentials still active on firewall; not remediated."
  required_evidence: "Screenshot or config file showing changed credentials and CIS benchmark compliance."

recommendation:
  - "Remediate firewall configuration"
  - "Resubmit updated self-assessment and re-audit this provision"

You’re thinking exactly in the right direction. Let’s clarify and formalize the role of the self-assessment in the Cyber Essentials certification evaluation process.

⸻

✅ High-Level Understanding

You’re correct:

The self-assessment is a structured questionnaire, where each question maps to one or more provisions, and vice versa.

🎯 Purpose of Self-Assessment

The self-assessment helps the organization:
	•	Perform a preliminary internal audit.
	•	Ensure they’ve addressed all mandatory shall provisions.
	•	Collect and attach evidence for each question.
	•	Clearly define their compliance status before requesting an official certification audit.

The certification body uses it to:
	•	Understand what the org claims is already implemented.
	•	Use it as a mapping guide to evaluate provisions during the audit.
	•	Decide whether additional clarification or inspection is needed.

⸻

🧩 Structural Mapping Between Questions and Provisions

Here’s the typical structure:

🔄 Bidirectional Relationship

Self-Assessment Question	→ Maps To Provision(s)
“Do all employees receive annual cyber awareness training?”	A.1.a (shall), A.1.e (should)
“Is there an updated inventory of all software assets?”	A.2.a, A.2.e (shall)
“Are firewalls configured to restrict inbound traffic?”	A.4.f (shall), A.6.a (shall), A.6.d (should)

Conversely:

Provision (A.1.a)	← Input from Questions
“Cyber awareness training shall be provided…”	Q1: Training frequencyQ2: Training materialQ3: Completion tracking


⸻

🧪 How Provisions Are Evaluated Using the Self-Assessment

Step-by-Step:
	1.	Organization answers question → e.g., “Yes, awareness training is conducted annually.”
	2.	Organization attaches evidence → e.g., employee training logs, screenshots of LMS completions.
	3.	Each provision aggregates:
	•	✔ The mapped questions
	•	📎 The evidence provided
	•	✅ The claimed compliance status
	4.	Certification body audits provision:
	•	Check if the provision is fully supported by the answers.
	•	Inspect the attached evidence.
	•	Mark the provision as:
	•	✅ Passed
	•	❌ Failed
	•	⚠️ Needs clarification

📌 Only provisions labeled “shall” are mandatory. Failure of one = certification denied.

⸻

📘 Example: Provision A.1.a Evaluation

Element	Example
Provision	A.1.a: “The organization shall put in place cybersecurity awareness training for all employees…”
Mapped Questions	Q1: “Do you conduct cyber awareness training?”Q2: “How often is the training refreshed?”Q3: “Do you have role-based training content?”
Self-Assessment Answer	Q1: YesQ2: AnnuallyQ3: Yes, separate content for devs and execs
Attached Evidence	- Training policy PDF- Screenshot from LMS showing 100% completion
Auditor Judgment	✅ PASS — training exists, is refreshed annually, and evidence is sufficient

🔧 In Practice

Most real-world implementations of CSA Cyber Essentials use:
	•	Spreadsheets or web forms where:
	•	Each row = 1 question
	•	Columns include:
	•	Mapped provision(s)
	•	Compliance (Yes/No/Partial)
	•	Notes
	•	Evidence upload field
